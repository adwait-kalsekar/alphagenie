['Crude oil prices moved lower today after the Energy Information AdministrationÂ\xa0reportedÂ\xa0an inventory increase of 2.7 million barrels for the week to April 12. ThisÂ\xa0comparedÂ\xa0with a significant build of 5.8 million barrels for the previous week and an estimated 4-million-barrel build for the week to April 12 asÂ\xa0reportedÂ\xa0by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday.\n\n\n At the same time, the EIA reported declines in gasoline and middle distillates, which at the time of writing had not changed the direction of oil prices. In gasoline, the authority estimated an inventory draw of 1.2 million barrels for the week to April 12, which compared with a modest build of 700,000 barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production during the reporting period averaged 9.4 million barrels daily. This amounted to a slight decline from the previous week. In middle distillates, the authority estimated an inventory decline of 2.8 million barrels for the week to April 12. This compared with a build of 1.7 million barrels for the previous week. Middle distillate production for the period averaged 4.6 million barrels in the week to April 12, which was almost unchanged on the previous week. Oil prices, meanwhile, extended their decline that started earlier this week, driven by apparent expectations that the risk of a serious supply disruption as a result of military escalation in the Middle East is rather limited. APIâ\x80\x99s inventory build estimate also helped pressure prices.\n\n\n "For now, the near-term weakness in oil prices may reflect some expectations that tensions may still be contained and that other key oil producer such as Saudi Arabia may jump in to mitigate any global supply shock," IG analyst Yeap Jun RongÂ\xa0toldÂ\xa0Reuters earlier today. â\x80\x9cOur base case is one where tensions remain contained, avoiding a wider conflict that disrupts oil supply,â\x80\x9d Standard Chartered analyst Han Zhong LiangÂ\xa0toldÂ\xa0Bloomberg, suggesting that the risk of escalation appears to be limited for the time being, helping keep prices lower. At the time of writing,Â\xa0Brent crudeÂ\xa0was trading at $89.10 per barrel andÂ\xa0West Texas Intermediate was changing hands for $84.55 per barrel, both down from opening.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT'
 'In recent months, several oil majors have emphasised the need for greater investment in oil and gas. Many fossil fuel companies have increased their oil and gas output in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Russian energy, to support government energy security efforts and fill the gap until there are sufficient green alternatives to meet the rising global energy demand. However, as governments worldwide pursue a green transition, scientists and environmentalists are stressing the need to cut fossil fuel funding to ensure that climate targets, such as those of the Paris Agreement, are met.Â\xa0 In March, at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston, the CEO of Saudi Arabiaâ\x80\x99s state-owned oil company Aramco, Amin Nasser, emphasised theÂ\xa0ongoing global dependence on fossil fuels. Nasser suggested that instead of pumping money into green energy, governments should support the expansion of fossil fuel operations worldwide, to ensure energy security in the face of the growing global energy demand. This opinion was shared by several other attendees at the conference representing a wide array of oil and gas companies.Â\xa0\n\n\n Nasser caught the attention of climate activists last year when he publicly disagreed with the International Energy Agencyâ\x80\x99s (IEA) prediction that oil, gas and coal demand willÂ\xa0peak in 2030. He accused the IEA of being overly U.S.- and Europe-centric and overlooking the growing demand in other parts of the world. He, and several other oil and gas representatives, believe that we must continue to fund oil and gas operations until there is an alternative energy source that is stable and large enough to meet the global energy demand.Â\xa0 However, many scientists and environmentalists believe that the only way to achieve a widespread green transition is by cutting funding to fossil fuel operations in favour of renewable alternatives. There are several reasons for this view. Firstly, the money being spent on oil and gas exploration and related operations could be better spent on research and development into alternative energy sources. Secondly, funding new fossil fuel operations will lead to the production of higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions for decades longer. Thirdly, so long as fossil fuels are being used as a safety blanket, governments and consumers across the globe are unlikely to take the green transition seriously, as there is no imminent need for the switch beyond the threat of climate change.Â\xa0 In 2021, the IEA stated the need for an â\x80\x9cunprecedented transformation of how energy is produced, transported and used globallyâ\x80\x9d to achieve international climate goals. The Agencyâ\x80\x99s 2021 Roadmap showed that the pledges at that point fell â\x80\x9cwell short of what is necessary to reach net?zero emissions globally by 2050.â\x80\x9d It also highlighted several milestones that need to be achieved to support climate pledges, such as bringing an end to the sales of new fossil fuel boilers by 2025 and banning the sale of new internal combustion engine cars by 2035. Overall, the IEA emphasised that there should be â\x80\x9cno investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants.â\x80\x9d Despite the IEAâ\x80\x99s continued efforts to draw attention to the dire state of the energy industry and the need to make an imminent shift away from fossil fuels in favour of green alternatives, governments and private companies have continued to fund oil, gas and coal projects. Some are doing this because they view fossil fuels as necessary for energy security and others are doing it for the high revenues that oil and gas bring to the table.Â\xa0 One lesser-explored criticism of oil and gas funding is its longevity. Some investors believe that although fossil fuels have offered a good return on investment in recent years â\x80\x93 particularly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine â\x80\x93 they do not offer a sound long-term investment. Tom Steyer, the founder and co-executive chair of Galvanize Climate Solutions, an investment firm focused on the energy transition,Â\xa0writes, â\x80\x9cIf thereâ\x80\x99s one lesson Iâ\x80\x99ve learned in decades as an investor, itâ\x80\x99s that things change. On closer examination, the simplest argument against funding new oil, gas and coal projects is not that theyâ\x80\x99re immoral. Itâ\x80\x99s that theyâ\x80\x99re unsound.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0\n\n\n Steyer believes that investing in new oil and gas projects is risky as they wonâ\x80\x99t come online for several years; much of the oil and gas in traditional oil-rich regions has depleted and accessing the remaining supplies through technologies such as fracking will be more expensive; the oil and gas industry relies heavily on government subsidies, which are likely to be reduced as countries worldwide undergo a green transition; and massive funding into green energy in recent years has led to several major technological breakthroughs and the rapid expansion of renewable energy capacity. This suggests that investing in new fossil fuel projects could be a bad move, not only for climate change efforts but also in terms of profitability.Â\xa0'
 'The campaign for institutional investors to divest from oil giants like BP and Shell hasnâ\x80\x99t made any progress due to the way index providers dominate the market, a new study has found. Only 60 institutional investors worldwide have sold all of their shares in BP and Shell, representing about three per cent and four per cent of their shareholders, a paper published earlier this year by David Whyte of Queen Mary University of London has revealed.\n\n\n These shares have all been promptly bought up by massive asset managers like Blackrock and Vanguard, who have risen to popularity through their market-tracking index funds. With Shell currently the largest company listed in the UK, and BP number five, tracking the index has meant buying more and more of their shares, and the passive giants have been happy to do so. Since 2015, Blackrock has increased its shareholding in BP by 3.2 percent, with Vanguard at 1.8 percent. The same rise is true for Shell, with the two asset managers buying 1.8 percent and 1.6 percent more stock, respectively. Tracking shareholders between 2015 and 2022, Whyte found that the largest institutions had actually increased their shareholding in the oil giants, while the smallest have been more likely to divest. Indeed, although 47 per cent of BP shareholders and 54 per cent of Shell shareholders have reduced their stakes over the years, net share ownership overall has risen significantly in both companies. Overall, the top 20 oil giant shareholders have increased their shares by three-quarters of a billion in BP and half a billion in Shell.\n\n\n â\x80\x9cAny trend towards divestment amongst the shareholders who have reduced their shareholding is being offset by the largest shareholders,â\x80\x9d said Whyte. Even the investors who cut their stake in Shell and BP are probably not doing it for ESG reasons, as over a quarter of the 20 investors who made the most significant reductions in shareholdings in the companies actually increased their overall fossil fuel investment. Campaigners have been pushing for the largest institutional investors to divest their stakes in fossil fuel companies, with Greta Thunberg withdrawing from the Edinburgh Book Festival last year due to its sponsorship by Baillie Gifford, which invests in fossil fuel companies. BPâ\x80\x99s capital expenditure on low-carbon energy, such as solar and wind, is currently only three percent of its total investment, while Shellâ\x80\x99s is nine percent. All other investment was spent on fossil fuels and high carbon energy sources.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT â\x80\x9cShareholder movements in BP and Shell are not applying the pressure necessary to cease oil and gas development,â\x80\x9d Whyte concluded.'
 'OPEC+ has sufficient spare production capacity to control a price rally, but its approach to increasing output will be crucial.Iran\'s direct attack on Israel on Saturday evening is viewed certainly as an escalation in the Middle East conflict. Tehran\'s missile and drone attack (widely unsuccessful) has been well-telegraphed (read: here & here) for the last two weeks, pushing up Brent crude oil futures above the $90 a barrel mark on heightened geopolitical risks in the region.Â\xa0 Iran\'s direct attack on Israel could lead some traders to reevaluate the geopolitical risk premium even more. And this is because Tehran\'s attack on Israel was direct, instead of through the usual foreign proxies such as Lebanon\'s Hezbollah militia and Yemen\'s Houthi rebels. So far, crude prices have been up 17.5% this year and have surged nearly 4% since the strike on Iran\'s embassy earlier this month.Â\xa0\n\n\n "Oil prices might spike at the opening, as this is the first time Iran struck Israel from its territory," said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG, as quoted by Bloomberg.Â\xa0  Staunovo added, "How long any bounce will last will also depend on the Israeli response." According to Iman Nasseri, Middle East managing director at consultancy FGE, Brent crude has already priced in about a $10 risk premium. He said another $2 to $5 premium could be priced in on further concerns about tit-for-tat attacks across the region.Â\xa0 On Sunday, Iran warned the US if it supports an Israeli counterattack, then expect further escalation in the conflict across the region, especially with missiles and drones targeting US military bases.Â\xa0 Adding more fears in energy markets is the report earlier on Saturday that Iran\'s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard seized an Israeli-linked container ship near the Strait of Hormuz, a critical maritime chokepoint in the region. Already, Iran-backed Houthis have targeted US and Israeli ships in the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, yet another critical maritime chokepoint that disrupts global trade flows.Â\xa0\n\n\n  Making sense of this all is Bloomberg\'s commodity expert Javier Blas, who outlined a few conclusions for energy markets following the flare-up in violence overnight: All in all, higher crude prices are terrible news for President Biden\'s reelection odds as inflation reaccelerates. We explained to readers in early March that the probability was rising that America\'s enemies would \'weaponize crude\' against the US to trigger the next financial shock.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT'
 'Over the last two years, the U.S. has significantly boosted its oil and gas production, despite also developing its renewable energy capacity. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Russian energy, the world experienced energy shortages and many countries found their energy security to be under threat. This led many countries in North America, Europe, and other parts of the world to look for alternative energy supplies to ensure they had enough oil and gas to meet their needs. Despite having put restrictions on the development of U.S. crude supplies and strongly backing a green transition, the shortages led President Biden to ask oil and gas companies to boost their production to help decrease reliance on Russia and ensure U.S. energy security.Â\xa0 Fossil fuel producers around the globe are now on track to almostÂ\xa0quadruple the quantity of extracted oil and gasÂ\xa0from recently approved projects by 2030. Following the recent increase in oil and gas activity, the U.S. is leading this trend to the potential detriment of its climate pledges.Â\xa0\n\n\n The International Energy Agency (IEA) has repeatedlyÂ\xa0statedÂ\xa0that no new oil and gas infrastructure can be developed if the world hopes to limit global warming to 1.5oC. This is the limit that 196 parties agreed upon when signing the Paris Agreement, including the U.S. However, an estimatedÂ\xa020 billion barrels of oil equivalent of new oil and gas have been discoveredÂ\xa0since the IEA originally stated this in 2021. Scientists now believe that if we continue to develop oil and gas resources, the 1.5oC warming limit could be exceeded within a decade.Â\xa0 The U.S. hasÂ\xa0produced more oil than any other country has done in historyÂ\xa0every year for the past six years. In 2023, the U.S. broke a record by extracting more oil and gas than ever before, at around 12.9m bpd of crude. This is over double the quantity that the U.S. was producing just a decade ago, and it comes in the wake of President Bidenâ\x80\x99s ambitious climate pledges. The U.S. also broke gas production records last year, following the development ofÂ\xa0several new gas terminals, with more in the works. U.S. exports of LNG are expected toÂ\xa0doubleÂ\xa0in the next four years based on the current pipeline.Â\xa0 Although the rise in U.S. oil and gas output was widely accepted following the shortages felt due to sanctions on Russian energy, this is not likely to be a short-term trend. The U.S. expects to hit more record highs for crude production in 2024 and 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). By the end of the year, U.S. oil production is expected to increase by 290,000 bpd toÂ\xa013.21 million bpd. The government expects to continue to produce near-record levels of oil and gas up to 2050, which will produce a massive amount of greenhouse gas emissions. This strategy appears to be at odds with Bidenâ\x80\x99s ambitious climate pledges and could put Paris Agreement targets at risk on a global level.Â\xa0 The U.S. moves will have a significant impact on the global green transition, as the worldâ\x80\x99s largest producer of crude. AroundÂ\xa0a third of the worldâ\x80\x99s planned oil and gas expansionÂ\xa0from now until 2050 is expected to take place in the U.S., according to the findings of a recentÂ\xa0report. The ongoing oil and gas activities planned for the U.S. are likely to undermine international efforts for a green transition, not only because they will contribute significantly to global GHG emissions but also because they may deter other countries from shifting away from fossil fuels to green alternatives.Â\xa0 The last three COP climate summits have highlighted the need for high-income countries toÂ\xa0support developing statesÂ\xa0in the establishment of their renewable energy industries and encourage them to leave oil and gas in the ground. However, it is unlikely that poorer countries with the potential to benefit from oil and gas production will forgo fossil fuel revenues in favour of a green transition when the U.S. (and other rich states) continue to earn money from oil and gas production.Â\xa0\n\n\n Despite great enthusiasm around the launch of the most far-reaching climate policy to date â\x80\x93 the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act â\x80\x93 the U.S. isÂ\xa0failing to reduce its carbon emissions at the rate neededÂ\xa0to meet its climate goals. Greenhouse gas emissions fell by around two percent in the U.S. last year, following an increase in green energy investment, which helped accelerate the Biden administrationâ\x80\x99s green transition. However, this figure is far below the rate required to meet the governmentâ\x80\x99s target to reduce U.S. emissions by 50 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. As the countryâ\x80\x99s oil and gas output continues to rise, it is highly unlikely that the U.S. will meet its climate targets, even if it continues to rapidly develop its renewable resources, which will have a detrimental impact on global climate aims.Â\xa0'
 'Global oil demand growth is slowing due to â\x80\x9cexceptionally weakâ\x80\x9d deliveries in developed economies at the start of the year, the International Energy Agency (IEA)Â\xa0saidÂ\xa0on Friday as it revised down its 2024 world demand growth forecast by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd). The rise in oil consumption continues to lose momentum, with first-quarter growth estimated at 1.6 million bpd, which is 120,000 bpd below the IEAâ\x80\x99s previous forecast, the agency said in its Oil Market Report today.\n\n\n With most of the post-Covid rebound behind us, global oil demand is set to grow by 1.2 million bpd this year and growth is set to further slow to 1.1 million bpd next year, the IEA said. Just last month, the IEA had raised its 2024 outlook on global oil demand growth, by 110,000 bpd from the February report and expectedÂ\xa0demand growth at 1.3 million bpdÂ\xa0for 2024, compared to 1.2 million bpd expected in the previous monthâ\x80\x99s report. The agency is now reversing this upward revision to oil demand growth amid â\x80\x9cexceptionally weakâ\x80\x9d deliveries in OECD, waning effect of the post-Covid rebound, and vehicle efficiencies and an expanding EV fleet. Global oil demand is now returning to its historical trend, Toril Bosoni, Head of Oil Industry and Markets Division, and CiarÃ¡n Healy, Oil Market Analyst at the IEA, wrote in aÂ\xa0commentaryÂ\xa0today. â\x80\x9cDespite the deceleration that is forecast, this level of oil demand growth remains largely in line with the pre-Covid trend, even amid muted expectations for global economic growth this year and increased deployment of clean energy technologies,â\x80\x9d they said.\n\n\n The IEAâ\x80\x99s demand growth estimates are well below these of OPEC, whichÂ\xa0confirmedÂ\xa0on Thursday its forecast of global oil demand growth of 2.2 million bpd for 2024, broadly unchanged from last monthâ\x80\x99s assessment. The cartel still sees â\x80\x9crobust growthâ\x80\x9d of 1.8 million bpd in 2025 compared to 2024.Â\xa0 Global oil demand in the summer is expected to be strong as consumption of transportation fuels is set to rise across the board and across regions with summer and holiday travel picking up, OPEC said on Thursday. The group sees a â\x80\x9crobust oil demand outlook for the summer months.â\x80\x9d'
 "Over the past three years, the U.S. energy sector has enjoyed an oil price boom that has been accompanied by soaring crude production. According to data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA),Â\xa0crude productionÂ\xa0climbed from 11.0 mb/d in July to 2020 to an all-time high of 13.3 mb/d in December 2023 as producers ramped up output to meet heightened demand as well as take advantage of high prices in the post-pandemic period.Â\xa0 According to commodity analysts at Standard Chartered, the U.S. shale patch did much of the heavy lifting, with the horizontal rig count (a proxy for shale oil activity and a leading indicator of output trends) rising for three straight years at a time when an output gap remained, with supply still below its pre-pandemic peak. Given these tailwinds, output hit an all-time high in the final two months of 2023 with year-over-year growth clocking in at over 1 million barrels per day.Â\xa0\n\n\n However, it appears that the U.S. shale patch will not be able to sustain that clip much longer. High decline rates for shale wells usually set in soon after commissioning, meaning extra well completions are required to offset declines from existing wells if output is to be maintained. Unfortunately, StanChart has reported that the horizontal rig count started to decline sharply in early 2023, and is currently 20% below its post-pandemic peak after flatlining for the past six months.Â\xa0 The analysts point out that whereas the completion of previously drilled wells and technical change provide an offset, a significant fall in activity, more often than not, leads to a lagged decline in growth. The analysts have predicted that U.S. crude output will clock in 300 kb/d lower than the pre-pandemic peak by the end of the year.  Related: Orlen Trading Switzerland Investigated for Possible Sanctions Breach This thesis appears to be playing out, with the EIA reporting that U.S. crude output declined from 13.3 mb/d in December 2023 to 12.5 mb/d in January 2024. The EIA agrees with StanChartâ\x80\x99s assessment and has predicted that production will continue to fall in the second and third quarters of 2024 before rebounding in 2025.  Source: EIA  Source: Standard Chartered Research Â\xa0Bullish Demand Growth\n\n\n Luckily for the oil bulls, most experts have predicted that global oil demand will continue to grow in the coming years. OPEC Secretariat has forecast demand growth of 2.247 mb/d in 2024, StanChart at 1.719 mb/d, the EIAâ\x80\x99s forecast is 1.43 mb/d while Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) currently has the lowest 2024 demand growth forecast at 1.33 mb/d. For 2025,Â\xa0 the OPEC Secretariat forecast is 1.847 mb/d; StanChart's at 1.424mb/d while EIA 2025 demand growth forecast is 1.379mb/d. The IEA will report its first demand growth forecast for 2025 when it releases its latest Oil Market Report (OMR) on 12th April. Interestingly, demand growth might even surpass those predictions due to an unsuspected factor: the war in the Middle East. Last month, the IEA made a 110,000 barrels per day (bpd)Â\xa0upward revisionÂ\xa0of its global oil demand from its previous forecast saying shipping disruptions on the Red Sea caused by Hamas attacks would lead to higher fuel consumption as ships take the 4,000-mile detour around the African continent. â\x80\x9cDisruptions to international trade routes in the wake of turmoil in the Red Sea are lengthening shipping distances and leading to faster vessel speeds, increasing bunker demand,â\x80\x9d the agency said, using a term for the fuel needs of ships. Brent crude recently broke out above USD 90/bbl even as volatility remains subdued. According to StanChart, the realized 30-trading day volatility stood at a six-month low of 17.5% at settlement on 8 April, quite unusual given the significant geopolitical uncertainty as well as low and falling inventories. StanChart says this implies the oil market is being pushed higher by tightening fundamentals rather than speculative action. Last week, front-month Brent climbed USD 2.96/bbl w/w to settle at USD 90.38/bbl on 8 April, briefly hitting a five-month high of USD 91.91/bbl intra-day on 5 April.Â\xa0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT The same can, however, not be said about natural gas markets. Last week, European gas futures rose 5% toward â\x82¬29/MWh, driven by fears of attacks on Ukrainian gas storage facilities and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. However, thereâ\x80\x99s not much scope for a big rally at the moment with Europe flush with gas. The European gas injection season has already begun, with inventories building for seven consecutive days.Â\xa0 According to Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE)Â\xa0data, inventories stood at 69.58 billion cubic meters (bcm) on 7 April, good for a 5.54 bcm Y/Y increase and 21.27 bcm above the five-year average. StanChart has pointed out that the current inventory level was not attained until early May last year and the five-year average reached the same level in early June. StanChart has also predicted that lower prices may be needed early in the 2024 season to prevent maximum storage being reached prematurely in the current year."
 'The world\'s largest crude oil exchange-traded fund has bled over $2 billion in less than a year. And it\'s not due to investors finding greener pastures elsewhere with other ETFs; it\'s the siren call of soaring prices that\'s prompting this mass exodus. The WisdomTree Brent Crude Oil exchange-traded commodity had assets under management of some $2.5 billion last summer, according to Bloomberg. Now, the publication reports, this is down to $396 million, with withdrawals accelerating over the past few days.\n\n\n In that, withdrawals seem to be following price trends. Brent earlier this month topped $90 per barrel and, after a short pause earlier this week, is back above that threshold again following the latest Israeli strike on the Gaza Strip amid reports about a possible ceasefire. While it is true that prices are currently driven higher mainly by geopolitical events, fundamentals are also at play. A growing number of forecasters are updating their predictions for benchmarks this year on expectations of resilient demand and increasingly tighter supply. And investors are following the trend. Even those who have not sold their ETF holdings in order to invest more directly in the rally are benefitting. That same WisdomTree Brent Crude Oil ETCÂ\xa0generatedÂ\xa0returns of over 13% during the first quarter of the year as opposed to an average 8.8% gain in the S&P 500.  Related: OPEC Expects Solid Global Oil Demand This Summer The WisdomTree exchange-traded commodity became the world\'s largest oil fund at the beginning of last year. The fund saw inflows of over $1 billion, which poured in as the deflation in oil prices that had begun in late 2022 extended into the new year. Now, the trend has reversed and it has reversed strongly. The WisdomTree Brent Crude Oil ETC is not the only fund seeing outflows. The U.S. Oil Fund, which used to be the world\'s biggest oil fund before the WisdomTree inflows last year and is now the world\'s biggest oil fund once again, also saw a flurry of investor exits as benchmarks climbed higher. According to Bloomberg, the fund\'s assets under management currently stand at $1.3 billion, down from some $5 billion during the pandemic. In further evidence that oil makes money, the Middle East is about to become the only region in the world with three trillion-dollar sovereign wealth funds. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is worth $993 billion, Bloomberg reported in March, while the Saudi Public Investment Fund and the Kuwait Investment Authority are breathing down its neck.\n\n\n Meanwhile, investment in transition-related stocks is on the decline, according to data reported by Reuters. The S&P Global Clean Energy Index is down by 10% since the start of the year. In comparison, the S&P 500 Energy Index, which comprises Big Oil names, has gained 16.3%. The data shows that investors are growing wary of all the promises made by transition advocates as evidence mounts that these were not based on due diligence. Wind and solar stocks suffered a crash last year when this first became clear. Now, we are witnessing a continued awakening among investors to the challenges and the realistic potential of transition technology and alternative energy sources. "With conventional energy having its own bull run, I think the alternative funds will struggle for the foreseeable future, and we shall see what the election brings," the managing director of capital markets at Phoenix Capital Group Holdings told Reuters. The comment summarizes the challenging situation for alternative energy investment and highlights the rebound of interest in oil and gas, much to the chagrin of decision-makers on both sides of the Atlantic. In both Europe and the U.S., things can get even worse for the transition after the respective electionsâ\x80\x94in June for European Parliament and in November for U.S. President. It will certainly be an interesting year in energy.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT'
 'The mergers and acquisitions (M&A) wave sweeping through the U.S. oil and gas industry has reached Canada, which could see a megamerger in the coming months. Â\xa0Â\xa0 Smaller deals are already taking place as 2023 saw an increase in the value of transactions in Canada\'s oil and gas sector.\n\n\n Unlike in the United States, most Canadian firms are not in an urgent need to add future drilling inventory as the oil sands have years of crude yet to be produced. The Groundwork for Canadian Oil & Gas Deals The next M&A wave in Canada will consist of opportunistic â\x80\x93 rather than necessary â\x80\x93 deals, analysts say. And many of these would likely be focused on non-oil sands assets such as the Duvernay shale or Williston Basin. Likely buyers include U.S. firms seeking inventory at lower valuations compared to the top U.S. shale plays. The Canadian industry can afford to be opportunistic â\x80\x93 it has strengthened significantly balance sheets and paid down debts thanks to the higher oil prices of the past two years. The price of Canada\'s heavy crude from Alberta, Western Canada Select (WCS), relative to the U.S. benchmark WTI, is set to rise this year as the expanded Trans Mountain Pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia isÂ\xa0set to begin operationsÂ\xa0next month. The higher takeaway capacity means that Alberta\'s oil producers will enjoy more pipeline capacity than they can fill, for the first time in nearly a decade. Uptick in Canadian M&AsÂ\xa0 Canada has already seen in recent months several deals including Baytex Energy acquiring Ranger Oil Corporation forÂ\xa0US$2.2 billionÂ\xa0including debt, Crescent Point Energy buying Hammerhead Energy, and ConocoPhillipsÂ\xa0buying the remaining 50% interest in Surmont from TotalEnergies for approximately US$2.7 billion in cash.  Related: UK Confident Its Energy Demand Will Be Met at All Times This Summer The Canadian oil & gas industry saw 27 M&A deals announced in the fourth quarter of 2023, worth a total value of $4.2 billion, according toÂ\xa0GlobalData\'s Deals Database. In terms of value, M&A activity in Canada\'s oil and gas sector jumped by 20% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous quarter\'s total and soared by 95% as compared to Q4 2022. The two biggest deals in Canada\'s oil and gas sector since 2022 took place in 2023â\x80\x94the ConocoPhillipsÂ\xa0acquisition of TotalEnergies\' stake in Surmount and Pembina Pipeline\'s minority acquisition of Alliance Pipeline, Aux Sable Canada and NRGreen Power Limited Partnership. Â\xa0 In October, Tom Pavic, president of Sayer Energy Advisors, toldÂ\xa0The Canadian PressÂ\xa0"I think you\'ll still see some more consolidation, for sure. I think there\'s still going to be some more transactions."Â\xa0\n\n\n At the start of 2024, bankers and analysts continued to believeÂ\xa0more energy dealsÂ\xa0are in the works in Canada.Â\xa0 Over the past year, there has been growing interest from U.S. companies to buy Canadian oil and gas assets, especially private U.S. firms, Brad Wells, head of energy at BMO Capital Markets, told Bloomberg in anÂ\xa0interviewÂ\xa0this week. While Canadian firms are in no need to add inventories, their healthy balance sheets could spur them to seek opportunistic deals that have the right economics and strategic rationale, Wells said, adding that because of the expected opportunistic nature, it is difficult to predict when the next big merger in Canada will be announced.Â\xa0Â\xa0 Still, a megadeal such as the ones being announced in the U.S. could happen in Canada, too, albeit with different rationale in mind, BMO\'s top energy banker told Bloomberg. Last year, deal-making accelerated in all of North America as companies are looking to strategically position themselves for the future. Immediately after the 2020 crash in prices, many companies entered into deals because combinations helped both buyers and sellers to weather the low prices and demand. In 2023, with oil higher prices and profits from 2022 at record-highs, companies started thinking about their future inventory and geographical focus or diversification.Â\xa0 Stronger Canadian Industry Things are looking up for Canada\'s oil and gas sector this year, which could lead to more mergers and not fire sales. U.S. companies, including corporations and private equity firms, have shown growing interest in Canadian oil and gas players due to their lower valuations, high reserves, and increasing takeaway capacity, analysts and dealmakers toldÂ\xa0ReutersÂ\xa0at the end of last year.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT Amid high prices and fierce competition for assets in the Permian, Canadian non-oil sands resources could attract more buyers from the U.S. in the coming months. Â\xa0 Canada\'s oil will have increased access to markets soon, which is set to raiseÂ\xa0WCS pricesÂ\xa0as more capacity on the Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) pipeline would narrow the discount to the U.S. benchmark. Â\xa0Â\xa0Â\xa0 Global crude oil prices should remain relatively stable in 2024, but prices for Canadian producers are expected to rise once the TMX pipeline starts operating, Deloitte CanadaÂ\xa0saidÂ\xa0last week. WCS prices will increase as the differential with West Texas Intermediate narrows when the TMX begins calling on Canadian producers for line fill, said Andrew Botterill, national Oil, Gas & Chemicals leader at Deloitte Canada. "There\'s some optimism in the Canadian oil and gas sector this year, but that doesn\'t mean there won\'t be some volatility as the system adapts to its new capacity," Botterill noted.'
 'Despite indicating they would refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by the end of this year, the Department of Energy has now canceled solicitations offered last month. Citing rising oil prices, the DOE said, â\x80\x9cWe will not award the current solicitations for the Bayou Choctaw SPR site and will solicit available capacity as market conditions allow.â\x80\x9d Three million barrels of oil had been slated for delivery to the Bayou Choctaw SPR site in August and September.\n\n\n The SPR is the worldâ\x80\x99s largest supply of emergency crude oil. It was established primarily to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products and to carry out obligations of the United States under the international energy program. The SPR is maintained by the U.S. DOE and its oil stocks are stored in huge underground salt caverns at four sites along the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. The size of the SPR (authorized storage capacity of 714 million barrels) makes it a significant deterrent to oil import cutoffs and a key tool in foreign policy. Following Russiaâ\x80\x99s invasion of Ukraine, the Biden Administration made the largest withdrawal in SPR history to curb the oil price spikes that happened in the wake of the invasion. The DOE has consistently promised to refill the SPR as market conditions allow. One of the 2024 energy predictions I made in January had been â\x80\x9cThe Biden Administration wonâ\x80\x99t replace more than 10% of the oil removed from the SPR since Biden was inaugurated.â\x80\x9d The reasoning behind the prediction was that in election years, presidents have tended to withdraw from the SPR to prevent rising oil prices leading up to the election.\n\n\n My prediction concluded with â\x80\x9cBy the time the summer driving season and the change to summer gasoline blends arrives in May, I think the SPR purchases will be suspended.â\x80\x9d The DOE added, â\x80\x9cAs always, we monitor market dynamics to remain nimble and innovative in our successful replenishment approach to protect this critical national security asset.â\x80\x9d However, with production cuts in Saudi Arabia and Russia starting to impact the market, it is unlikely that there will be significant oil price relief ahead of the election. Thus, we will likely go into the election with the SPR at the current significantly depleted level.'
 'The OPEC+ group is firmly back in control of the oil market and has the power to have it extremely tight in the second half of the year should it choose to do so, industry executives and hedge fund managers say. The market is growing increasingly bullish on oil, expecting robust global demand growth and supply constraints, including OPEC and Russiaâ\x80\x99s production cuts, to push prices even higher in the summer. Â\xa0Â\xa0Â\xa0\n\n\n WithÂ\xa0Brent oil pricesÂ\xa0breaking above $90 a barrel, there is room for further upside amid tighter markets and heightened geopolitical risks, investment banks say, not ruling out $100 oil this year. The trajectory of oil prices over the next year is largely in the hands of the OPEC+ alliance of the top Middle Eastern producers and Russia, according to Sebastian Barrack, head of commodities at hedge fund giant Citadel, which had $61 billion in investment capital as of April 1. The OPEC+ group has â\x80\x9cdefinitely regained controlâ\x80\x9d of the market, BarrackÂ\xa0saidÂ\xa0at the FT Commodities Global Summit in Lausanne, Switzerland, this week. If the alliance decides in early June to keep its current cuts after the end of the first half, we could see an â\x80\x9cextremely tightâ\x80\x9d oil market in the second half of the year, Citadelâ\x80\x99s executive said, adding that the timing of OPEC+â\x80\x99s potentially eased cuts and their volume â\x80\x9cwill define where prices go in the next 12 months.â\x80\x9d  Related: OPEC+ Faces Fork in the Road Right now, prices are going up, as geopolitical concerns linger in the Middle East, demand holds strong and could turn out stronger than expected, and supply and infrastructure issues hold back production and exports, fromÂ\xa0MexicoÂ\xa0to Russia. Top traders and forecasters, as well as investment banks, have upgraded their price and demand forecasts in recent weeks. Oil prices are set to trade in the range betweenÂ\xa0$80 and $100 per barrelÂ\xa0this year, Russell Hardy, chief executive at Vitol Group, said at the FT summit this week. The worldâ\x80\x99s largest independent oil trader also expects robust global oil demand growth in 2024, at around 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd) higher than in 2023, Hardy said.\n\n\n If this forecast pans out, this yearâ\x80\x99s growth in oil consumption will not be too far off the bumper increase in demand in 2023. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) raised its 2024 and 2025 forecasts of global oil consumption by between 400,000 bpd and 500,000 bpd, due to a revision of historical data for 2022 and to the â\x80\x9ccurrent market dynamics,â\x80\x9d the EIA said in its monthlyÂ\xa0Short-Term Energy OutlookÂ\xa0(STEO) on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley sees heightened geopolitical risk pushing Brent pricesÂ\xa0to $94 per barrelÂ\xa0in the third quarter as the bank lifted its price forecast by $4 a barrel compared to its previous projection. Last month, Morgan Stanley had already hiked its third-quarter oil price forecast by $10 per barrel,Â\xa0to $90, on the back of expected tighter markets in the summer. In recent weeks, banks, including JP Morgan, have said that oil prices could hit $100 per barrel by the end of the summer. However, demand destruction could prevent prices from reaching triple digits, JP Morgan says. Â\xa0 Still, analysts and industry executives believe that OPEC+ would reverse at least part of the cuts if prices run up to $100 as it would look to avoid demand destruction, stronger response to high prices from U.S. shale, and a potential loss of longer-term demand for OPEC+ crude.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT If OPEC+ rolls over the cuts beyond June, â\x80\x9cwe will see a level of tightness in the market that will be very constraining to the market, and high prices will have to go and help destroy demand to solve that problem,â\x80\x9d Citadelâ\x80\x99s Barrack said at the FT Commodities Global Summit. Â\xa0 As tempting as it may sound for OPEC to sell oil at $100 a barrel, the cartel may not be willing to risk another inflation shock that could cripple demand.Â\xa0'
 'OPEC+ once again extended its oil production cuts this month. The decision was anything but unexpected and, unlike previous production policy announcements, it had the desired effect on prices. However, it could only work for so long. Soon, OPEC will need to make a decision. Last year, oil traders were almost exclusively focused on demand and threats thereof, especially in China. This year, they are beginning to understand that withholding 2.2 million barrels of oil daily while global demand actually rises will, at some point, start eating into supply. Oil prices are on the rise.\n\n\n True, some OPEC+ members have been producing more than their assigned quota, and they have been asked to take steps to compensate, which normally means temporary deeper cuts. But it seems that overproductionâ\x80\x94and the rising output of quota-exempt Iran, Venezuela, and Libyaâ\x80\x94has not interfered with the purpose of the cuts. Only they cannot continue forever. Some analysts have noted in the past few months that OPEC+ will have to start unwinding the cuts at some point, especially if Brent crude tops $100 per barrel. The argument made by these analysts is that at that point, prices will start destroying demand as they usually do. Yet OPEC+ may decide to stick with the cuts until oil is well above $100, according to the CEO of Dubai-based consultancy Qamar Energy, Robin Mills. In a recent opinionÂ\xa0pieceÂ\xa0for The National, Mills suggested sticking with the cuts is one of the two roads ahead of OPEC, with all foreseeable consequences, such as higher inflation and higher U.S. production.  Related: The Energy Sector Is A No-Brainer, but Thereâ\x80\x99s More to Come The other road Mills describes as OPEC believing its own strong demand forecasts and unwinding the cuts. This is definitely one way of framing the road ahead. In the same vein, however, one could argue that sticking to the cuts is also a sign of belief in OPECâ\x80\x99s strong demand expectations: if demand is so resilient and prone to expand, it will expand even in a higher-price environment. This is precisely what happened in 2022 when the start of the Russia/Ukraine conflict pushed oil above $100 per barrel and held it there long enough for the annual average to come in at close to $95 per barrel. Demand during that year of high oil pricesÂ\xa0roseÂ\xa0by over 2.5 million barrels daily. And that was before China came roaring back from the pandemic lockdowns, which only ended in late 2022.\n\n\n So, while it would make sense to expect OPEC+ to start thinking about putting an end to its production cuts, it might make more sense to keep them in placeâ\x80\x94not least because an unwinding of the cuts would have about the same effect on prices as the news that U.S. shale output grew by over 1 million bpd last year. OPEC expects oil demand this year to grow byÂ\xa02.2 million bpd. With the cuts in place, this rate of demand growth is certain to push the global market into a deficit. Estimates of the size of this deficit vary, with the IEA seeing a â\x80\x9cslightâ\x80\x9d deficit as a result of the OPEC+ cuts and stronger demand prompted by the Red Sea situation. Qamar Energyâ\x80\x99s Mills, however, sees a deficit of as much as 4 million barrels daily developing later in the year. Should this happen, there would be nothing easier for OPEC than announcing an end to the cuts, or at least a tweak, to avoid a price slump. And a deficit environment would be the best time to make these tweaksâ\x80\x94with prices high and demand resilient, the effect of such an announcement on prices would be mitigated by the fundamentals. Because the cuts canâ\x80\x99t go on forever, not when some OPEC members are already grumbling against the quotas.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT'
 'Big Oil is trumping the Magnificent Seven on the stock market this year in an oil stocks rally that few had expected a few months ago. Â\xa0 Energy stocks have outperformed the top tech stocks this year as the market has grown more bullish on oil and crude prices rallied at the end of the first quarter and at the start of the second quarter.\n\n\n How long and how high the so-far quiet rally will go will depend on the oil price trajectory this year. Â\xa0 In recent weeks, analysts have started to raise earnings projections for Big Oil\'s performance this year amid rising crude oil prices. Moreover, energy company valuations continue to trade at discounts to the S&P index and the energy sector continues to be the cheapest in the market, attracting investors who are bullish on energy. Big Oil Beats Big Tech Just a few months ago, not so many investors were bullish on oil and gas. All the market attention, and rightfully so, was on the Magnificent Seven â\x80\x93 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla â\x80\x93 and their performance in 2023, when these stocks combinedÂ\xa0jumped by 75%. This compared to a 23% gain in the S&P 500 and an 11.6% collective rise in all the other 493 S&P 500 stocks last year. But this year, the stellar performance has come from a more unexpected sectorâ\x80\x94energy. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLE) hasÂ\xa0risen by 15%Â\xa0year to date, compared to a 9% rise in the NASDAQ 100. In March alone, the energy sector was the top performer among all 11 sectors in the S&P 500, with a 10% gain, compared to a 3.1% rise in the index.Â\xa0 Last week, the energy sector in the S&P 500 posted its first record close since the middle of June 2014.Â\xa0 "Most investors coming into 2024 weren\'t expecting anything out of energy," Roth analyst Leo Mariani toldÂ\xa0BloombergÂ\xa0last week. Energy stocks "roared back like a lion with an awesome March," Mariani added.Â\xa0 Â\xa0 For example, large companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips rose by 12% each last month, and refiners are also performing well, amid constraints in oil product supply due to crippled refining capacity in Russia and the re-routing of global seaborne fuel trade away from the Red Sea and Suez Canal.\n\n\n Marathon Petroleum had surged by 42% year to date to Monday, while Valero Energy\'s stock had gained 38% year to date to April 8. Rising oil prices and energy sector valuations at bargain prices have been attracting investors in oil stocks in recent months, analysts say. Although oil prices are not the only reason for the energy stock rally, they have contributed a lot, as has an improved outlook on the economy. $100 Oil? WithÂ\xa0Brent oil pricesÂ\xa0hitting $90 per barrel at the start of the second quarter, energy stocks continued their rally from March. Oil prices rose last week to the highest level in nearly six months amid flare-ups in the Middle East and the OPEC+ group leaving its ongoing production cuts unchanged. Â\xa0 With Russia now focused on production cuts and markets tightening, $100 oil is not to be ruled out, analysts say. Â\xa0 "At face value, and assuming no policy, supply or demand response, Russia\'s actions could push Brent oil price to $90 already in April, reach mid-$90 by May and close to $100 by September," JP Morgan strategists led by Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note at the end of March, as carried byÂ\xa0Yahoo Finance. However, demand destruction could prevent prices reaching triple digits, JP Morgan says. OPEC+ will also have a say in where oil prices will go in the summer and beyond. The group\'s current extra voluntary cuts expire at the end of June, and the alliance is meeting in early June to decide what to do nextâ\x80\x94roll over the output reductions or start easing the cuts.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT Some see weaker refining margins as a drag on the oil price rally. "If we look at the demand side, refinery margins have weakened with the recent move higher in crude oil," ING strategists Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey wrote in aÂ\xa0noteÂ\xa0on Monday. "In order for this rally to be sustained (in the absence of supply disruptions or ratcheting up in geopolitical risks), we need to see refinery margins strengthening with crude oil," they noted. With fairly good demand and stable prices around $90 per barrel OPEC+ is more likely to start easing the cuts from July, analysts say. Goldman Sachs, for example, reckons that the group wouldn\'t want to push prices too high and potentially to $100 a barrel or above. "While still a close call, we assume that OPEC+ won\'t push oil prices to extreme levels because the 2022 energy crisis showed that extreme prices destroy long-term residual demand for OPEC barrels by boosting non-OPEC supply and boosting capex in alternatives to oil," analysts at Goldman SachsÂ\xa0wrote in a recent note carried by MarketWatch.'
 'Brazilian oil and gas company Enauta may soon change the face of Latin American fossil fuels by establishing an independent oil and gas company with 3R Petroleum Ã\x93leo e GÃ¡s. This is the most recent of several ambitious moves by Enauta to expand its oil and gas operations in Brazil. In recent months, the firm has signed several contracts to acquire stakes in multiple offshore oilfields in the region, thereby boosting its production capacity. The proposal to merge with 3R, if accepted, could lead to the establishment of a major new independent company in the region.Â\xa0 The Brazilian oil firm 3R Petroleum Ã\x93leo e GÃ¡s announced it has temporarily halted talks with PetroReconcavo, over a proposed merger, opening the door for an alternative deal. Enauta proposed a new merger offer to 3R, which could lead to the creation of â\x80\x9cone of the most diversified independent oil and gas companies in Latin America,â\x80\x9d if accepted. If the merger goes ahead, the independent company will have a production capacity of over 100,000 bpd. The growing interest in 3R led its stocks to rise by 7.3 percent following the announcement.Â\xa0\n\n\n This move by Enauta follows aÂ\xa0growing â\x80\x98megamergerâ\x80\x99 trendÂ\xa0being seen worldwide. In the U.S., both Chevron and Exxon announced a major new deal in October, with Occidental following in December, and Diamondback in February. Meanwhile, small oil and gas companies in Brazil have been looking to consolidate operations following a widespread buy-up of assets formerly owned by state-owned Petrobras.Â\xa0 Enauta presented 3R with an all-stock offer. The deal would mean 3R shareholders hold 53 percent of the company, while Enauta shareholders would hold 47 percent. This is expected to provide a "balanced, five-year high organic growth portfolio with ability to add value in an environment of consolidation and resilience to commodity pricing cycles,â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0according to Enauta. The firmâ\x80\x99s board of directors unanimously approved the proposal, believing the new independent company could attain a strategic positioning in domestic and international capital and banking markets. The firm believes that its deal is superior to that of PetroReconcavo in terms of â\x80\x9cstrategic positioning, governance, tangible synergies and from a risk management perspective.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0 EnautaÂ\xa0explained, â\x80\x9cThe transaction will lead to state-of-the-art governance, with diversified reference shareholders, a predominantly independent board of directors with an experienced executive team. There will be growth opportunities in offshore and onshore operations, mitigating operational, geological and regulatory risks, complementarity in teams, talent attraction and retention and strong adherence to ESG principles.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0 This is just one of many moves by Enauta to expand its operations in recent months. In December the firm signed a deal with Petrobras toÂ\xa0purchase two offshore oil and gas fieldsÂ\xa0â\x80\x93 UruguÃ¡ and TambaÃº â\x80\x93 in the Santos Basin, as well as natural gas pipeline infrastructure. This is expected to cost Enauta $10 million, with a potential $25 million more for oilfield development.Â\xa0 That same month, EnautaÂ\xa0signed a contract with QatarEnergy BrasilÂ\xa0to acquire a stake in the Campos Basin oilfields. The company expected to acquire the whole 23 percent stake previously held by QatarEnergy in the Abalone, Ostra and Argonauta oilfields, which comprise the Parque das Conchas. The zone is operated by Shell, which has a 50 percent equity stake. Production stands at around 35,000 bpd from 25 wells connected to the FPSO EspÃ\xadrito Santo platform. This is expected to cost Enauta a total of $150 million.Â\xa0\n\n\n In March, Enauta also signed a deal with Houston-based Westlawn Americas Offshore (WAO) to purchase a 20 precent participating interest in the BS-4 concession for $301.7 million. Enauta released aÂ\xa0statementsaying, â\x80\x9cPartnerships are important drivers for value generation and risk-sharing in the development of megaprojects such as Atlanta and Oliva. Since Atlantaâ\x80\x99s Phase I investment was sanctioned in March 2022, Enauta has been approached by several potential partners interested in joining the projectâ\x80¦ The signing of a 20 percent minority stake with WAO is aligned with principles of Enautaâ\x80\x99s value generation strategy, capital allocation efficiency and management of a balanced high growth, high risk-adjusted return oil and gas portfolio.â\x80\x9d Enauta has been rapidly building up its oil and gas portfolio in Brazilâ\x80\x99s offshore region, with the purchase of stakes in several oilfields. This will help boost production in the coming years and allow it to grow as an independent oil and gas company. This could be enhanced further by a potential merger with 3R Petroleum Ã\x93leo e GÃ¡s, if accepted, which would lead to the creation of a major Latin American independent with high production output and a significant stake in the Brazil region.Â\xa0'
 'All major North Sea oil countries are expected to continue drilling for oil and gas as they fail to agree on climate measures. The major oil-producing countries operating in the North Sea have all announced ambitious production goals for the coming years, despite pressure from European governments and environmentalists to reduce fossil fuel production in favour of renewable energy projects.Â\xa0 A new report found that none of the major oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea have plans to stop drilling in time to achieve the 1.5oC global heating limit. The Oil Change International report says that the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark have not been able to align their oil and gas policies with their climate promises under the Paris Agreement. The report suggested that the policies in Norway and the U.K. were furthest from the Paris climate agreement as they were both â\x80\x9caggressivelyâ\x80\x9d exploring and licensing new oil and gas fields. Meanwhile, the Netherlands hopes to increase its oil and gas production.Â\xa0\n\n\n While Germany produces only small quantities of oil and gas in the region, the government has failed to set adequate climate policies for a green shift. Denmark came out on top, having reduced its oil production by half in the last five years. The Scandinavian country has set an end date for oil and gas production and has cancelled new state-initiated licensing rounds. However, environmentalists are calling on the Danish government to close loopholes that allow new licensing under certain circumstances to be closed by the early 2030s rather than in 2050.Â\xa0 The co-author of the report, Silje Ask Lundberg, emphasised the need for governments in the region to do more to curb oil production and act on climate pledges. LundbergÂ\xa0stated, â\x80\x9cFailure to address these issues not only undermines international climate goals but also jeopardises the liveability of our planet.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0 Many believe that the five North Sea countries should be leading the way when it comes to climate action, rather than contributing to the problem. These are some of the worldâ\x80\x99s richest countries and it is unjust to expect the developing world to undergo a green transition while they continue to benefit from oil and gas production. Truls Gulowsen, the head of the Norwegian branch of the environmental group Friends of the Earth, stated of Norwayâ\x80\x99s role in the North Sea, â\x80\x9cDespite having all the tools in the world to ensure a just transition, our governmentâ\x80\x99s choice is to continue to be Europeâ\x80\x99s most aggressive oil and gas explorer. This is completely out of place, and totally unaligned with the Paris Agreement and our climate responsibility.â\x80\x9d The U.K. has been heavily criticised for its ongoing support of oil and gas production, as the government announced 24 new North Sea oil and gas licences in January. Licenses were given to 17 oil firms, including Shell and BP, to drill in the Central North Sea, Northern North Sea, and West of Shetland areas. Opposition MPs and environmentalists labelled the move as â\x80\x9cgrossly irresponsibleâ\x80\x9d and suggested that the government wasÂ\xa0overstating the economic benefits of the North SeaÂ\xa0and compromising the U.K.â\x80\x99s climate leadership.Â\xa0 Graham Stuart, the minister for energy security and net zero, defended the move,Â\xa0stating, â\x80\x9cIf we didnâ\x80\x99t have new oil and gas licences we would import new [liquefied natural gas] from abroad which is four times as carbon-intensive as the gas produced here. I accept itâ\x80\x99s counterintuitive but itâ\x80\x99s not a complex argument to see itâ\x80\x99s the right thing to do.â\x80\x9d He added, â\x80\x9cNew oil and licences strengthen our ability to get to net zero, they strengthen and support our climate leadership.â\x80\x9d\n\n\n However, critics suggest that although the move secure billions in oil and gas revenues, it will do little to secure the countryâ\x80\x99s energy supplies or decrease energy bills because the new licences will mostly produce oil that the U.K.Â\xa0typically exports to European refineries. Others accuse the government of greenwashing for suggesting that new oil and gas production could ever contribute to the countryâ\x80\x99s decarbonisation efforts.Â\xa0 Meanwhile, in Norway,Â\xa0oil and gas companies plan to invest a total of $21.85 billion in 2024, marking an increase from $20.5 billion in 2023. This is an increase from the previous forecast of around $18 billion. This comes following several new developments and the expansion of existing projects, as well as inflation and a weak currency. Despite deriving aroundÂ\xa098 percent of its domestic energy from renewable sources, Norway continues to be Europeâ\x80\x99s largest oil and gas producer, with an output of around 4 million bpd. The governmentâ\x80\x99s aim to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 appears to be at odds with its strategy to continue to explore for and develop new oil and gas fields.Â\xa0 Instead of leading the world in a shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives, five of the worldâ\x80\x99s richest countries and proponents of a green transition continue to support oil and gas production in the North Sea. The countries have no clear plan to cut production or work together to establish steps to achieve their climate pledges when it comes to North Sea operations, undermining their roles as â\x80\x98climate leadersâ\x80\x99.Â\xa0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT'
 'First it was a group of children in Montana. Then, in Portugal, a group sued their local governments for allowing climate change to happen. The Montana groupÂ\xa0even won. It\'s open season for suing governmentsâ\x80\x94and Big Oil. Of course, the supermajors have been a top target for environmentalist groups and some local authorities in the U.S. for years, but the lawsuits have not really resulted in any significant victories for the plaintiffsâ\x80\x94yet.\n\n\n But now it seems that anyone who has reason to be unhappy with their lot can just take Big Oil to court, which is exactly what one Belgian farmer did a month ago. According to Hugues Falys, "Climate change is having a tangible impact on my work and life: yield losses, extra work, and the stress that comes from dealing with a disrupted crop calendar." "My profession is intimately linked to the climate. In recent years, climate change has caused farmers a great deal of damage and left us uncertain about the future," the farmerÂ\xa0explainedÂ\xa0in March. Yet rather than suing all the Big Oil majors, Falys singled out TotalEnergiesâ\x80\x94possibly because it is the largest fuel distributor in Belgium. Falys\'s case opens in mid-April, and it may be interesting to keep an eye on developments in the courtroom as a possible sign of things to come. Meanwhile, Shell\'s appeal against a landmark climate ruling by a Dutch court also began this month in The Hague. Back in 2021, the District Court in The Hague ordered the oil supermajor to slash its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 in a first-of-its-kind ruling in a climate case brought by environmentalists that could set precedents for other oil companies. The court said Shell must start doing this immediately and include the so-called Scope 3 emissions, those generated by the use of its producers, per the order. Shell appealed the ruling and, at the hearing, will argue that the original ruling had no legal basis and that it also overstepped the boundaries of judiciary authority, per theÂ\xa0Financial Times. The environmentalist organization that won the original case, for its part, will present the same argument it used in 2021: that Shell has an obligation to act in accordance with studies suggesting the oil and gas industry causes changes in weather patterns and in accordance with international agreements such as the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, that same group of activists, Friends of the Earth, is threatening to sue INGâ\x80\x94a Dutch lender that, like all lenders, does business with the oil and gas industry. The reason: that the bank does business with the oil and gas industry.\n\n\n In January this year, Friends of the Earth sent the CEO of ING, Steven van Rijswijk, a notice of legal liability, informing him that the bank had violated its legal obligations "by contributing to dangerous climate change." In another remarkable development in the litigation world, a climate NGOÂ\xa0claimsÂ\xa0that Big Oil majors can be sued for what they call "climate homicide." The theory is that Big Oil knew about climate change but hid it, while climate change caused fatalities. For now, many believe this theory is outlandish and it would break down in court but its authors are not giving up, saying there has been interest from prosecutors. Suing Big Oil is already a business, and in some cases it can be a lucrative business. Pushing the boundaries of what grievances can be taken to court is a marked feature of the litigation push against Big Oilâ\x80\x94and a sign of tough times to come for an industry with a big climate change target on its back.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT'
 'Colombiaâ\x80\x99s national oil company Ecopetrol, regarded as one of the best-managed state-controlled energy companies in Latin America, is still dealing with allegations of murder, extortion, and intimidation. Since the early 2000s, rumors have swirled over Ecopetrolâ\x80\x99s financing of rightwing paramilitary militias, which suppressed leftist guerillas, quashed organized labor, and quelled community dissent against controversial energy as well as mining projects. Those events occurred at a crucial time for Colombia with the government desperate to reinvigorate an economically crucial hydrocarbon sector by restructuring Ecopetrol and attracting greater foreign energy investment. While violence has fallen since the 2000s,Â\xa0the bloody struggle for Colombiaâ\x80\x99s oil wealthÂ\xa0endures with the latest allegations casting a dark shadow over Ecopetrol. In 2003, then-President Alvaro Uribe restructured state-owned Empresa Colombiana de PetrÃ³leos to form what is now known as Ecopetrol. This overhaul removed the unprofitable responsibilities associated with being Colombiaâ\x80\x99s hydrocarbon regulator, transforming the company into a nimbler profitable integrated energy major focused on petroleum exploration and production. By the end of 2007, Ecopetrol had completed a $2.8 billion initial public offering (IPO) listing on Colombiaâ\x80\x99s Stock Exchange, the Bolsa de Valores de Colombia (BVC). Roughly a year later the energy major listed on the New York Stock Exchange using American Depositary Shares (ADS), which are equivalent to 20 of the companyâ\x80\x99s common shares. As of the end of December 2023, Ecopetrol remains controlled by Bogota, which owns 88.49% of the company.Â\xa0\n\n\n Since the 2007 IPO, Ecopetrolâ\x80\x99s market value, after roaring to a record high during the 2013 oil boom, has crashed, with its market value down by a whopping 53%. Despite growing optimism surrounding the integrated oil companyâ\x80\x99s operations,Â\xa0there are signs Ecopetrolâ\x80\x99s market valueÂ\xa0will never recover to earlier highs, with several headwinds weighing on the energy majorâ\x80\x99s outlook. Among the most serious are Colombiaâ\x80\x99s low proven reserves, lack of exploration success, and heightened geopolitical risk, especially afterÂ\xa0leftist president Gustavo Petro took officeÂ\xa0in August 2022, impacting the driller. The sensational allegations regarding Ecopetrolâ\x80\x99s ties to Colombiaâ\x80\x99s paramilitary death squads and their decades-long campaign of violence, kidnapping, and murder is further weighing on the energy majorâ\x80\x99s outlook. Paramilitary units first emerged in Colombia during the late 1960s as citizen defense groups partnered with the security forces to protect local communities from the depredations of Marxist guerillas. By the 1980s, they had been coopted by large landowners, corporations, and the cocaine cartels, which used them to not only suppress leftist insurgents but also to intimidate the local populace while protecting their business interests. This saw those armed bands, in effect, transition intoÂ\xa0rightwing death squads serving the interests ofÂ\xa0Colombiaâ\x80\x99s wealthy elite. By the end of 1997, the paramilitary militias were operating under the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC â\x80\x93 Spanish initials), an umbrella organization that unified their leadership and power into one representative body.Â\xa0 Paramilitary militias were responsible for the largest portion of deaths in Colombiaâ\x80\x99s nearly seven-decade-long civil war, which despite claims to the contrary, continues to this day. The Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP â\x80\x93 Spanish initials), a non-punitive truth and reconciliation commission founded by the 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC â\x80\x93 Spanish initials),Â\xa0estimates approximately 450,000 peopleÂ\xa0died during the conflict. The tribunal found around 80% of those victims were civilians, with the special judicial body concluding that paramilitaries were responsible for nearly half of all civilians killed, while leftist guerillas murdered 27% and the state security forces 12%. There is considerable evidence indicating right-wing death squads operated with impunity, not only because of collusion with elements of Colombiaâ\x80\x99s security forces but also due to ties to the state. For over a decade, serious allegations circulated that Colombiaâ\x80\x99s army, police, and internal intelligence service, called the Administrative Department of Security (DAS - Spanish initials), aided and abetted paramilitary operations. Over time significant evidence, notably witness testimony, emerged indicating that paramilitary militias received arms, training, logistical support, and intelligence from security forces. There are even assertions that Colombiaâ\x80\x99s political and business elite, including corporate executives, lawmakers, government ministers, and presidential staff, colluded with the leadership of the AUC and senior paramilitary commanders. The para-politics scandal, which began in 2006 after the demobilization of the AUC,Â\xa0revealed the close, almost symbiotic, relationshipÂ\xa0between Colombiaâ\x80\x99s paramilitary militias and political as well as business elites. This highlighted the tremendous economic as well as political clout wielded by the AUC and paramilitary commanders in Colombia which led to the evolution of whatÂ\xa0came to be known as the para-economy. As such, the AUC transformed into an integral economic intermediary and powerbroker, which came to be a natural ally of corporations, notably energy, mining, and agricultural enterprises, operating in Colombia.Â\xa0 For decades, leftist guerillas considered Colombiaâ\x80\x99s petroleum infrastructure a legitimate target in their struggle against the state and U.S. imperialism. By the 1980s, with Colombiaâ\x80\x99s army seemingly incapable of stemming attacks, the payment of protection money from oil companies to the ELN and FARC was a lucrative source of income for the Marxist guerillas. As raids on hydrocarbon infrastructure and demands for protection payments grew, energy companies turned to private security to protect their operations. This led to frequent instances of oil companies contracting paramilitary militias to safeguard assets which eventually evolved into the provision of other services, including the intimidation of organized labor officials, environmental defenders, journalists, and human rights campaigners. It is the city of Barrancabermeja, at the center of Colombiaâ\x80\x99s oil heartland, where Ecopetrolâ\x80\x99s main 250,000 barrel per day refinery is situated, which emerged as a major flashpoint.Â\xa0 Barrancabermeja, a city of nearly 200,000 located in the Middle Magdalena Valley toward the western part of the Santander department, was a focal point for leftist guerilla activity since the multiparty low-intensity asymmetric conflict erupted in the 1960s. By the 1980s, the ELN, which was founded in Santander in 1964, and FARC dominated the rural areas around Barrancabermeja and nearby municipalities. After the surroundingÂ\xa0countryside had been pacified by Colombiaâ\x80\x99s security forcesÂ\xa0and militias linked to cocaine cartels in the early 1990s, Bogota directed that Barrancabermeja be cleansed. The forthcoming restructure of Ecopetrol, along with an urgent need to reinvigorate Colombiaâ\x80\x99s waning yet economically crucial oil industry, including bolstering reserves, exploration, and production, made subduing guerilla activity in the city a vital geopolitical objective. It is alleged that at the behest of senior Ecopetrol representatives and government officials, rightwing death squads orchestrated a campaign of terror, including massacres, kidnapping, and disappearances, in and around Barrancabermeja.Â\xa0 In early 2023, former senior paramilitary commander Salvatore Mancuso, once the AUCâ\x80\x99s second in command,Â\xa0implicated state-controlled Ecopetrol in the financingÂ\xa0of paramilitary militias. The warlord, who admitted to involvement in over 300 murders,Â\xa0testified before the JEPÂ\xa0(Spanish) that Ecopetrol bankrolled paramilitary units and their operations. Mancuso went on to claim Colombiaâ\x80\x99s national oil company maintained close ties with rightwing death squads, which in return for payments, protected the companyâ\x80\x99s infrastructure, especially pipelines and well-heads, from attacks by leftist guerillas. The former AUC commander also claimed senior Ecopetrol representatives provided lists of trade union officials, human rights campaigners, and community leaders opposed to controversial energy projects who were to be intimidated, kidnapped, and even murdered. According to Mancuso, those services were paid for, in part, byÂ\xa0allowing paramilitary militias to tap gasoline pipelinesÂ\xa0(Spanish) and siphon fuel for later resale with the full knowledge of Ecopetrol officials.\n\n\n A former Ecopetrol deputy security chief, Jose Eduardo Gonzalez Sanchez,Â\xa0asserted that company executives financed and collaboratedÂ\xa0(Spanish) with paramilitary militias in Barrancabermeja. Sanchez, who was once an army captain and eventually joined the Central Bolivar Bloc paramilitary militia,Â\xa0claims he coordinated meetings between senior military, police, DAS commandersÂ\xa0(Spanish), high-ranking company officials, and paramilitary leaders. The ex-Ecopetrol employeeÂ\xa0testified at the JEP that the use of paramilitariesÂ\xa0(Spanish) to quash leftist guerillas as well as their supporters in Barrancabermeja was frequently discussed at those meetings. HeÂ\xa0further claimed that meetingsÂ\xa0(Spanish) were held with Ecopetrolâ\x80\x99s corporate director of security, Marco Tulio Restrepo, and the Secretary of Security of the Presidency of the Republic, retired General Antonio Sanchez Vargas, to encourage the use of paramilitaries.Â\xa0 According to Sanchez, those events set the scene for the Central Bolivar Bloc, Colombiaâ\x80\x99s largest paramilitary militia, to enter Barrancabermeja and initiate a campaign of terror against the civilian populace. The former Ecopetrol security chief even claims the company hired a Bell UH-1 military-style helicopter to transport weapons and other logistics for the rightwing death squads operating in and around Barrancabermeja. Like other corporations operating in Colombia, it is alleged Ecopetrol representatives provided rightwing death squads with lists of employees, including trade union members and those regarded as troublemakers, which saw them intimidated, kidnapped, and murdered. The paramilitary offensive began during the late 1990s and ended in the early 2000s with thousands of civilians displaced, kidnapped, murdered, and forcibly disappeared. Most victims were not Marxist insurgents or their supporters but noncombatants, mainly trade union officials, community leaders, and environmental activists.Â\xa0 Rodrigo PÃ©rez Alzate, the commander of the Central Bolivar Bloc militia known by the alias Julian Bolivar,Â\xa0testified before a 2009 Justice and Peace hearingÂ\xa0about the paramilitary militiaâ\x80\x99s involvement in the extortion of trade union officials and their murders. This included the circulation of a â\x80\x9cblacklistâ\x80\x9d of trade union members who were to be killed and admitting the responsibility for the murder of 15 unionists in Barrancabermeja. It is believed those activities led to the murder of several members of Colombiaâ\x80\x99s oil workers union (USO â\x80\x93 Spanish initials). The USO had been at loggerheads with Ecopetrol regarding pay and conditions, the looming restructure of the state-controlled energy company, the dismissal of trade union members and employment of non-union contract labor. Indeed,Â\xa0U.S. Embassy officials recorded in a 2001 reportÂ\xa0that members of non-government organizations (NGOs) working in Barrancabermeja complained that security forces were cooperating with the paramilitaries.Â\xa0 Representatives of the USO alleged in the same U.S. Embassy report that Ecopetrol contributes to the financing of the rightwing death squads by hiring paramilitary contractors and off-duty militia members for security and manual labor. There were also claims that paramilitaries controlled Barrancabermejaâ\x80\x99s gasoline cartel which was siphoning 4,000 barrels of gasoline daily from Ecopetrol pipelines, generating around $30 million annually for rightwing death squads. In fact, the AUCâ\x80\x99s former second in command, Mancuso testified that Ecopetrol officials turned a blind eye to paramilitary units tapping company pipelines to extract fuel for services rendered. That fuel was then sold at service stations, with Ecopetrol officials providing the required dyes to allow its sale, in territories under paramilitary control generating hundreds of millions of dollars in income for paramilitary militias.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT There is a dark legacy hanging over Colombiaâ\x80\x99s national oil company Ecopetrol which, despiteÂ\xa0promising to investigate, refuses to discloseÂ\xa0(Spanish) the nature of its relationship with Colombaâ\x80\x99s paramilitary militias. There is considerable evidence that from the late 1990s until the demobilization of the AUC in 2006 Ecopetrol financed the paramilitary militias which were responsible for most of the civilian deaths in Colombiaâ\x80\x99s multi-decade low-intensity asymmetric conflict. The rightwing death squadsÂ\xa0were used by corporations to intimidateÂ\xa0(Spanish) local communities, unionized labor, and human rights activists to secure controversial energy projects while protecting profits. In 2021,Â\xa0there were also allegations that Colombiaâ\x80\x99s largest paramilitary band, the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AGC â\x80\x93 Spanish initials), which refused to demobilize in 2006, assisted Ecopetrol to repel Marxist guerilla attacks on its facilities and intimidate trade union officials.'
 'Surging U.S. oil production and shifting global oil flows amid geopolitical flare-ups have boosted American crude exports to record-high levels in recent months. Now U.S. oil is encroaching on the key markets of the OPEC+ group, which has been restricting supply in an effort to boost oil prices. From Europe to Asia, buyers are purchasing more U.S. crude as sanctions against Russia and uncertainty over Venezuelaâ\x80\x99s sanctions relief renewal are making refiners anxious about importing Russian and Venezuelan crude. Europe has also turned to more U.S. oil as shipments from Asia are now taking longer to deliver cargo. Due to the Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, tankers mostly avoid the Red Sea/Suez Canal route â\x80\x93 the fastest shipping lane from Asia to Europe â\x80\x93 and are heading to the Cape of Good Hope around Africa. Â\xa0Â\xa0\n\n\n Record-High U.S. Exports As U.S. crude oil production defied forecasts of a significant slowdown in growth last year and hit new highs, again, exports from America increasedâ\x80\x94to a record-high level since the U.S. ban on most crude oil exports was lifted in 2015. Â\xa0 U.S. crude oil exports averaged an all-time high of 4.1 million barrels per day (bpd) last year, having jumped by 13%, or by 482,000 bpd, from the previous record set a year earlier, in 2022, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)Â\xa0showedÂ\xa0last month. Except for 2021, U.S. crude oil exports have increased every year since the ban on most exports was lifted in 2015. As U.S. oil output rose by 9% on the year to a record-high 12.9 million bpd, and as many American refineries are designed to use heavier and sour crude, the excess light sweet crude from the shale plays found more buyers abroad. As most U.S. crude production is light, sweet crude oil, it has created export incentives for market participants, the EIA noted.  Related: Could AI Spark a Boom in Natural Gas Demand? At the same time, OPEC+ continues to withhold supply to restore â\x80\x9cmarket stability,â\x80\x9d or in other words, to prop up crude oil prices. â\x80\x9cUS production is going up and OPEC and Russian production is going down â\x80\x94 so the US, by definition, is going to have more market share,â\x80\x9d Gary Ross, an oil consultant turned hedge fund manager at Black Gold Investors, toldÂ\xa0Bloomberg. U.S. Boosts Market Share in Europe and India Last year, Europe became the largest buyer of U.S. crude oil, after the Western sanctions on OPEC+ producer Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. TheÂ\xa0inclusionÂ\xa0of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil in Dated Brent pricing also spurred buying of the U.S. crude variety.\n\n\n The WTI crude oil included in determining the Dated Brent price is delivered into Rotterdam, a large crude oil storage and trading hub in the Netherlands. As a result, the Netherlands received more U.S. crude oil exports than any other country in 2023, averaging 652,000 bpd, per EIA estimates. So in total, U.S. crude oil exports to Europe averaged 1.8 million bpd last year, slightly more than U.S. exports to Asia and Oceania of 1.7 million bpd. American crude has replaced a large portion of Russian crude, which Europe imported before 2022. After the Netherlands, the second-largest market for U.S. crude was China, with imports from the U.S. averaging 452,000 bpd, more than double 2022 volumes, EIAâ\x80\x99s estimates showed. China imported much more Russian oil last year, as it was the biggest buyer of Russiaâ\x80\x99s crude which had to find new markets after the Western markets are now closed for Moscowâ\x80\x99s oil. India also gorged on cheaper Russian crude in late 2022 and in most of 2023, but has slowed imports from Russia after the U.S. tightened the sanction enforcement at the end of last year. Earlier this year, the U.S. also slapped sanctions on Russiaâ\x80\x99s state tanker operator Sovcomflot, making Indian buyers anxious about potentially running afoul of the U.S. sanctions. All Indian refiners are now reportedlyÂ\xa0refusing to takeÂ\xa0Russian crude transported on Sovcomflot vessels and are carefully checking the ownership chain of every tanker carrying Russian crude to make sure the vessels are not affiliated with Sovcomflot or other entities on the latest U.S. sanctions lists.Â\xa0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT India is set to import in April its highest oil volumes from the United States inÂ\xa011 monthsÂ\xa0as the stricter enforcement of the U.S. sanctions against Russia are slowing Russian crude flows to the worldâ\x80\x99s third-largest crude importer. Most of the crude bought in March for April loadings is WTI Midland, which, although more expensive than some Middle Eastern crude, is comparable to Russiaâ\x80\x99s Sokol grade, whose flows to India have been the most affected by the tightened U.S. sanction enforcement.Â\xa0 Â\xa0 Indian refiners are also said to haveÂ\xa0suspended purchasesÂ\xa0of crude from Venezuela as the U.S. sanctions waiver on Venezuelaâ\x80\x99s oil exports expires on April 18 and could lead to complications if not renewed. India and Europe are looking to diversify their crude oil supply from OPEC+ producers â\x80\x93 which include the biggest Middle Eastern exporters and Russia â\x80\x93 and U.S. crude is positioned to step in.'
 'Crude oil prices rose today after the Energy Information AdministrationÂ\xa0reportedÂ\xa0an inventory build of 3.2 million barrels for the last week of March. The authority also estimated draws in both gasoline and middle distillates. ThisÂ\xa0comparedÂ\xa0with an oil inventory build of 3.2 million a week earlier, which pushed prices lower at the time. It also compared with an inventory draw of 2.3 million barrels asÂ\xa0estimatedÂ\xa0by the American Petroleum Institute earlier this week.\n\n\n Gasoline inventories, however, shed 4.3 million barrels in the week to March 29, with production averaging 10 million bpd. These figures compared with an inventory build of 1.3 million barrels for the previous week, when production stood at an average of 9.2 million barrels daily. In middle distillates, the EIA reported an inventory decline of 1.3 million barrels for the last week of March, with production averaging 4.6 million bpd. This compared with a stock draw of 1.2 million barrels for the previous week and production averaging 4.8 million barrels daily. Prices, meanwhile, have been on the rise thanks mainly to geopolitical factors but also on the back of the fact that OPEC+ confirmed its current production policy of caps, which has already tightened oil supply and helped prices move higher. Earlier in the week, Brent crude hit the highest since last October as Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries continued fueling concern about global fuel supply security and Iran vowed to take revenge on Israel for the strike on its consulate that killed five.\n\n\n "The likelihood that continued restricted Russian product exports could further tighten US petroleum supplies has suddenly forced re-calculation of U.S. (oil) balances across the rest of this month and possibly beyond," Jim Ritterbusch from energy consultancy Ritterbusch and Associates,Â\xa0toldÂ\xa0Reuters. Analysts are wary of Iranâ\x80\x99s response to the Israel attack, too, with one suggesting to Reuters that it might not be â\x80\x9cas measuredâ\x80\x9d as on previous occasions. "Despite a flurry of diplomatic activity meant to turn down the heat on the situation, there is definitely a chance the Iranian response will not be as measured this time," Bob Yawger from Mizuho told the publication.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT'
 'When OPEC and its partners led by Russia first announced additional oil production cuts last year, the market brushed it off. Prices fell. Forecasts for peak oil demand echoed off news publications. OPEC+ persevered, however. It persevered to the point where some analysts noted that there was no longer a way back, and the cartel would have to make the cuts permanent if it didn\'t want to see prices plummet at the slightest sign of production growth. And then something happened. The market caught up.\n\n\n Brent crude closed above $87 per barrel on Friday and still has higher to go if analysts from some of the biggest banks are to be believed. Of course, analysts are often wrong since they are not immune to errors, and indeed, many made an error this time: they believed the oil demand decline predictions coming from organizations with a vested interest in such a development. And they missed the supply tightening risk. That tightened supply is already a fact. This is what prices are reacting to, as reports about declines in global oil inventories and lower OPEC+ output come in. McKinseyÂ\xa0reportedÂ\xa0in February that global oil inventories had shed 32 million barrels the previous month, with the tightening especially marked in OECD countries. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, alsoÂ\xa0reportedÂ\xa0an inventory tightening in late February, with Reuters citing a JP Morgan report warning that global oil inventories were at the lowest in seven years, per Kpler data.  Related: Who Is Behind Iran-Backed Houthi Threats To Attack Saudi Arabia? "The market has found a firmer footing with Brent trading above $80 for a while now, supported by what looks like a better-than-expected demand outlook together with the...tanker diversions keeping millions of barrels at sea for longer," Saxo Bank\'s commodities chief Ole Hansen commented at the time. Indeed, demand was perhaps the greatest underestimation on the part of analysts and traders. It is the expectation of weak demand that kept prices low for months even as OPEC cut production by over 2 million bpd, and even as forecasts about U.S. shale pointed towards much slower growth this year. Now that fresh demand data is coming in, prices are climbing higher. Since the start of the year, Brent has gained 11%, according toÂ\xa0Bloomberg, which recalled that OPEC had no plans to make changes to its output agreement at its next meeting, on Wednesday. "The OPEC cuts have been effective," Michael Hsueh, a Deutsche Bank strategist, told the publication. "The global market is either already in deficit or on the verge of turning into deficit."\n\n\n Indeed, Standard CharteredÂ\xa0warnedÂ\xa0of a deficit back in mid-2023. Yet, at the time, nobody listened. And why would they, when U.S. shale oil production was soaring unexpectedly, despite a lower rig count. Now, the warnings are multiplyingâ\x80\x94including one from the International Energy Agency that just three months ago forecast a comfortable supply situation on global oil markets because of weaker demand that would match the lower OPEC+ supply. It appears that most forecasters ignored the fact that production curbs amplify the disruptive effects of unforeseen events on market balance. In this case, these effects have come from the Red Sea situation where repeated Houthi attacks on ships have led to a massive reorganization of maritime transport that has added at least 100,000 bpd to global daily oil demand, and, more recently, Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that have affected fuel supply and raised concern about crude supply. Had OPEC+ not cut, the effect of these events would have probably been more muted. With the cuts, anything out of the ordinary has the potential to push prices sharply higher. This is why analysts have rushed to revise their forecasts, with Energy IntelligenceÂ\xa0reportingÂ\xa0last week that the dominant expectation is of a deficit. That deficit, according to forecasters, is the result of weaker-than-expected supply and stronger-than-expected demand. Once again, we see a discrepancy between actual trends in oil fundamentals and expectations of future changes in these trends, based on forecasts with questionable basisâ\x80\x94and bias. OPEC+, meanwhile, can sit back and relax while it watches prices creep higher still. "Every month that OPEC discipline remains in-place, Brent flat price will likely continue to catch up with where inventories and time spreads already are," Morgan Stanley analystsÂ\xa0saidÂ\xa0recently.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, those counting on continuous growth in U.S. oil supply that could offset OPEC+ cuts got a reality check from the latest numbers, for January, whichÂ\xa0showedÂ\xa0a decline rather than growth in outputâ\x80\x94due to harsh winter weather. While not unheard of and certainly not a sign of a long-term trend, the January output change in the U.S. provided a much-needed reminder that sweeping assumptions can be risky. The assumption that U.S. production will continue growing at the sameâ\x80\x94or fasterâ\x80\x94pace as it did last year and offset the OPEC+ cuts was among the riskier. The assumption that oil demand is in decline because some people somewhere who stand to benefit from such a decline predicted it would decline proved to be an even riskier one. And now everyone is catching up with the actual physical market, which was bound to happen sooner or later.'
 'After a sharp decline in the final quarter of 2023, U.S. gasoline prices areÂ\xa0surging againÂ\xa0in a pivotal election year, offering Republicans a fresh chance to pin the blame on President Bidenâ\x80\x99s green agenda much to the chagrin of the White House. According toÂ\xa0Bloomberg, citing new data from AAA Automobile Club, U.S. gas prices are now on course to hit the dreaded $4-a-gallon mark in the coming months, thanks to rising crude prices amid tightening supplies. But hereâ\x80\x99s the kicker: under most key metrics, the U.S. oil and gas industry has flourished under the Biden administration despite its push towards a carbon-free future, proving that not even Washington has sufficient power to single-handedly sway large, globally interconnected markets like oil and gas. GOP White House hopefuls were quick to lambast Biden and his energy policies in the post-Covid oil price rally that hit its zenith shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n\n  Source: Y-Charts Yet, Big Oil investors were hardly complaining.

Shortly after becoming president, Biden [in]famously canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline project designed to bring in more Canadian crude to U.S. refineries andÂ\xa0paused new LNG export permitsÂ\xa0pending an environmental review in 2023 ostensibly in a bid to woo climate voters.

Reuters U.S. crude production now significantly outpaces production by key rivals Saudi Arabia and Russia. Even better for the oil bulls, U.S. leadership is unlikely to be breached any time soon because no other country has even hit the pivotal level of 13.0 million b/d.

The best performer was TotalEnergies, which scored high on Disclosure, which refers to how open a company is about its operations, and on Climate Solutions, which covers investments in alternative energy. Like the rest of the companies analyzed, however, even TotalEnergies rated low on Alignment, which refers to the amount of oil and gas each company produces. Climate Action 100+ essentially criticized Big Oil for producing too much oil and gas, for not reporting enough about its operations, and for not investing enough in alternative energy. None of these criticisms are new, and none of them are going away. But they are coming at the industry at a time when physical demand for oil and gas is shattering forecasts of peak oil and gas. With them, the health of demand for oil and gas is also shattering the argument that a transition away from hydrocarbons is both possible and possible fast. Artificial intelligence is a pertinent example. Big Tech is in a rush to expand on its AI capabilities and sell them to everyone they work with. But there is a problem. AI data centers are even more power hungry than non-AI data centers. This means that AI is driving a surge in electricity demand, and even staunch advocates of the transition, such as Ernest Monitz, are admitting that this demand cannot be met without hydrocarbons. â\x80\x9cWeâ\x80\x99re not going to build 100 gigawatts of new renewables in a few years. Youâ\x80\x99re kind of stuck,â\x80\x9d Monitz said recently, asÂ\xa0quotedÂ\xa0by the Wall Street Journal in an article detailing the dilemma of AI developers: growth versus the emissions footprint of the energy used to power that growth. There is also the question of energy security. It may have disappeared from news headlines, but it is as pressing as it was two years ago. The UK recently reported oil and gas production from its part of the North Sea had plunged last year to the lowest since 1999. The plungeâ\x80\x9440% in oil production in the third quarter of the yearâ\x80\x94was driven by the UKâ\x80\x99s transition ambitions and a 75% windfall profit tax that discouraged producers from doing anything about expansion. Had the transition path been smooth, the lost output would have been replaced by electricity produced by wind and solar. Instead, the UK simplyÂ\xa0raisedÂ\xa0its hydrocarbon imports.\n\n\n Germany is another case in point as it commits billions of euro for the construction of new gas-fired generation capacity to back up its growing fleet of wind and solar installations. The government argues these power plants will be ready to switch to hydrogen if and when green hydrogen becomes commercially viable. However, this does not negate the fact that wind and solar need backupâ\x80\x94and the only viable backup right now and for a while yet are hydrocarbons. So, Climate Action 100+, which by the way, recently lost some high-profile members such as JP Morgan Asset Management, has a problem with Big Oil producing oil and gas when global oil demand is about to break another record this year. It also has a problem with the industryâ\x80\x99s transition plans: the plans are there, but how the companies will implement them has not been detailed, the group said in its assessment. This is a criticism that can be directed at most companies with a net-zero plan, if not all of them, including the members of the Climate Action 100+. While having a net-zero plan seems to be all the rage in the corporate world these days, not least under pressure from activist formations, these plans tend to be sparing on the nitty-gritty.Â\xa0 This is another unsurprising aspect of the transition push. Transition details come with price tags, and these price tags are lately proving to be quite a bit higher than originally expected. And the transition itself, at whatever cost, is not going as smoothly as it should have, per plans.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT Europe, the most ambitious transition champion, isÂ\xa0falling behindÂ\xa0its own transition targets. Despite being open about emissions. Despite discouraging oil and gas production. And despite having perhaps the most detailed net-zero plans in the world.'
 'Â\xa0 Despite feigning interest, Big Oil still appears to oppose the global green transition and could well stand in its way. As Saudiâ\x80\x99s state oil company leader condemns the green transition and calls for long-term oil production, other major industry players are voicing their scepticism around renewable energy and clean tech. Despite large investments into green energy and carbon-cutting projects from several oil and gas majors, Big Oil still appears to be heavily favouring fossil fuel production.Â\xa0\n\n\n This month, the CEO of Saudi Arabiaâ\x80\x99s state-owned oil company Aramco, Amin Nasser, said that the energy transition was failing and called for policymakers to abandon the â\x80\x9cfantasyâ\x80\x9d of phasing out oil and gas, with the demand for fossil fuels expected to continue growing in the coming years. During a panel interview at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston, NasserÂ\xa0stated, â\x80\x9cIn the real world, the current transition strategy is visibly failing on most fronts as it collides with five hard realities.â\x80\x9d He went on to say, â\x80\x9cA transition strategy reset is urgently needed, and my proposal is this: We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately reflecting realistic demand assumptions.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0 Nasser has previously caught the energy worldâ\x80\x99s attention by claiming that oil and gas demand will not peak any time soon, contrary to claims by many energy experts. This came in response to an International Energy Agency (IEA) which predicted that oil, gas and coal demand wouldÂ\xa0peak in 2030. Nasser believes that the IEA view is overly U.S. and Europe-centric, and discards growing demand for fossil fuels in other areas of the world, particularly those countries in the Global South undergoing industrialisation.Â\xa0 The CEO of the worldâ\x80\x99s largest oil producer does not believe alternative energy sources will be rolled out on the scale required to displace hydrocarbons in the short- to mid-term, despite massive levels of investment in the sector in recent decades. At present, wind and solar energy contribute just three percent of the global energy supply, while electric vehicle (EV) penetration stands at around three percent, Nasser emphasised. In contrast, hydrocarbons continue to account for around 80 percent of the worldâ\x80\x99s energy supply, falling by just three percent in the last quarter of a century. While the demand for coal is expected to fall, this will be largely replaced by a higher global demand for natural gas â\x80\x93 the â\x80\x98cleanerâ\x80\x99 fossil fuel. Nasser believes that governments are in denial and that a shift to green will not provide enough energy to meet the growing global demand.Â\xa0 During the Houston Conference, other oil and gas executives echoed Nasserâ\x80\x99s views on the need for more investment in oil and gas. The CEO of Shell, Wael Sawan, highlighted the difficulties faced by the energy industry due to government bureaucracy in Europe, which was slowing the rollout of renewable energy projects. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobilâ\x80\x99s CEO Darren Woods emphasised the continued high demand for petroleum products. HeÂ\xa0stated, â\x80\x9cI think one of the things the policy to date and a lot of the narrative has been very focused on is the supply side of the equation and hasnâ\x80\x99t addressed the demand side of the equation. And the impact that price has on demand.â\x80\x9d He explained, â\x80\x9cAt the same time, the cost of converting and moving to a lower-carbon society if that cost is too high for consumers to bear, they wonâ\x80\x99t pay. And weâ\x80\x99ve seen that play itself out in Europe, with some of the farm protests and the yellow vest protests a year or so ago.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0 Following the conference, green campaigners criticised Big Oil for undermining the importance of the green transition and global efforts to tackle climate change. David Tong, the global industry campaign manager at advocacy group Oil Change International, stated â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s no surprise to see misleading claims like this coming at CERAWeek, because fossil fuel companies are the biggest cause of the climate crisis, and their continued political influence is the biggest obstacle to solving it.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0\n\n\n Many energy experts believe that oil majorsÂ\xa0should not be given such an important part to play in the global green transition, given their significant role in producing greenhouse gas emissions. The oil industry has long fought to quash the development of green energy projects for their own financial benefit, and it seems unlikely that they would give up their healthy oil and gas revenues in favour of a green transition. The oil industry has fought governments for decades over the development of clean technologies. A recent analysis shows that the industryÂ\xa0lobbied lawmakers to block support for low-carbon technologiesÂ\xa0such as solar panels, electric cars and heat pumps as far back as the 1960s.Â\xa0 There are several challenges to achieving a successful global green transition, and it still appears a long way off â\x80\x93 given the current contribution of renewable energy to the global energy supply. However, significant progress has been seen in renewable energy and clean technology over the last decade, strongly supported by high levels of public and private funding in the sector, which is expected to continue. Further, while demand for oil and gas is growing, much of this demand is expected to shift to green alternatives as they become available.Â\xa0Â\xa0'
 'The tightening sanctions on Russia\'s oil exports are raising freight costs for moving Russian crude and having India scrutinize deliveries to avoid opaque trades. The U.S. upped the ante in the sanctions game last month, and Russia may now have to work out new routes and ways to circumvent sanctions at a cost. Â\xa0 The sanctions\' estimated direct cost to deliver Russian cargoes now is around 6-8% of the price of a barrel of crude leaving the western ports in Russia for Asia, according to data from commodity price reporting agency Argus crunched byÂ\xa0Bloomberg.\n\n\n Argus hasÂ\xa0estimatedÂ\xa0that shipping a barrel of Russian crude from a port in the Baltic Sea to China has cost around $14.50 since December, with more than half of this per-barrel cost attributable to the Western sanctions.Â\xa0 The likely directly-related-to-sanctions cost to hire tankers to transport Russian oil is estimated at about $773 million since the end of December 2023, based on shipments tracking by Bloomberg. Â\xa0 "Whether this turns into actual supply losses will depend on how quickly workarounds are found for freight issues and whether Russian sellers are willing to deepen discounts," Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects, told Bloomberg. Â\xa0 Russia needs to find buyers for the crude oil that was left stranded after the U.S. slapped sanctions on Russia\'s state tanker operator Sovcomflot last month. China has come to the rescueâ\x80\x94most cargoes previously bound for India are now either discharging or heading to private refiners in the world\'s top crude importer.  Related: Oilprice Exclusive: An Interview With OPEC Sec. Gen. al-Ghais The U.S.Â\xa0leviedÂ\xa0new sanctions against Russia last month on the second anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and in response to the death of opposition politician Alexey Navalny. Among the 500 targets of the new sanctions, the U.S. Treasury and State are targeting Sovcomflot and more than a dozen tankers linked to the Russian state-owned firm. Â\xa0 Stranded cargoes of Russia\'s Sokol crude, previously headed to India but idled off South Korea and Singapore since the U.S. stepped up sanctions enforcement, started toÂ\xa0make their way to ChinaÂ\xa0earlier this month, beginning to clear a backlog of more than 10 million barrels of the grade sitting on tankers at sea.Â\xa0 With Indian refiners shying away from the Sokol grade, Russia is now looking for alternative buyers for its crude. Some barrels appear to have been placed with private Chinese refiners, often referred to as teapots, while others wait for other takers.\n\n\n Nearly half of China\'s Sokol imports in March have been from sanctioned tankers diverted from India, Armen Azizian, Senior Oil Risk Analyst at Vortexa,Â\xa0wroteÂ\xa0in an exclusive report this week.Â\xa0Â\xa0 On the other hand, Russian crude exports on Sovcomflot\'s fleet to India have dropped by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the 2023 average as exports on Sovcomflot\'s fleet shift towards China, Vortexa noted. All Indian refiners are now reportedlyÂ\xa0refusing to takeÂ\xa0Russian crude transported on vessels of Sovcomflot to avoid running afoul of the stricter enforcement of the U.S. sanctions on Russia. All Indian refiners are now carefully checking the ownership chain of every tanker carrying Russian crude to ensure the vessels are not affiliated with Sovcomflot or other entities on the U.S. sanctions list, unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg lastÂ\xa0week. Â\xa0 Russia could also move a lot of its oil with the "shadow fleet" of tankers it has amassed over the past two years to continue selling crude and products to willing customers under the radar. However, with India â\x80\x93 Russia\'s second-largest crude buyer after China â\x80\x93 more careful to avoid fallout from the stepped-up sanctions, Moscow will have to find new customers for some of its barrels, or see its revenues from oil diminished.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT Russia has admitted as much, with central bank governor Elvira NabiullinaÂ\xa0sayingÂ\xa0last week, "After the decline at the beginning of the year, exports have been rebounding, driven by the increase in oil prices. However, secondary sanctions hinder this process." Payments are also pressured by sanctions, the Bank of Russia governor said. "Due to sanctions, there are certainly difficulties with conducting cross-border payments," Nabiullina wasÂ\xa0quoted as saying by Russia\'s TASS news agency.'
 'Crude oil prices were in the red today after the Energy Information Administration reportedÂ\xa0an inventory build of 3.2 million barrels for the week to March 22. ThisÂ\xa0comparedÂ\xa0with a draw of 2 million barrels for the previous week, when the EIA also estimated a sizeable draw in gasoline inventories, which helped support prices.\n\n\n This week, the API inventoryÂ\xa0reportÂ\xa0that came out on Tuesday pushed prices lower as it estimated an inventory build in crude oil of over 9.3 million barrels for the week to March 22. For the week to March 22, the EIA reported more mixed changes in fuels. Gasoline stocks added 1.3 million barrels over the reporting period, with production averaging 9.2 million bpd. This compared with a draw of 3.3 million barrels for the previous week, when production stood at a daily average of 9.6 million barrels. In middle distillates, the authority estimated an inventory decline of 1.2 million barrels for the week to March 22, with production averaging 4.8 million barrels daily. This compared with a modest inventory build of 600,000 barrels for the previous week, when production averaged 4.7 million barrels daily. Oil prices that fell on Tuesday, meanwhile, continued depressed on Wednesday despite expectations that OPEC+ will leave its production policy untouched at it next meeting in early April.\n\n\n "A sharp rise in U.S. crude inventories and expectations for a potential inaction by OPEC+ in its output policy next week saw further unwinding in oil prices in todayâ\x80\x99s session, as profit-taking accelerates following a strong rally in mid-March," IG analyst Jun Rong YeapÂ\xa0toldÂ\xa0Reuters. â\x80\x9cWe should see a slightly tighter market in the second quarter, given OPEC+â\x80\x99s voluntary cuts are being extended,â\x80\x9d Sean Lim, analyst with Malaysian RHB Investment Bank,Â\xa0toldÂ\xa0Bloomberg. He noted, however, that prices were getting less sensitive to news from OPEC+. What they are getting more sensitive to, on the other hand, is suggestions of tighter supply on the horizon, including as a result of OPEC+ action. In the early months of the cuts most traders assumed there was plenty of supply around to offset them but now analysts are starting to predict a deficit, including theÂ\xa0International Energy Agency.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT'
 'US oil prices have recently jumped above the $80 a barrel mark - the highest level since late 2023, sending worrying signals to the Federal Reserve and overly anxious White House.Â\xa0 The surge in WTI has pushed wholesales gasoline prices up...\n\n\n  And worse, pump prices are set to accelerate even higher in the coming months to an average of $4 a gallon, which would be the highest level since the summer of 2022, according to Bloomberg, citing new data from AAA Automobile Club.Â\xa0  A combination of issues is pressuring futures and pump prices higher, including the transition to summer-grade gasoline and strained domestic refineries, as well as concerns about shrinking global crude product supplies while Ukraine attacks Russian refineries.Â\xa0 As we explained in the note titled "Dominoes Falling As Biden Admin Deals With Twin Energy Crisis In Russia, Middle East," traders have been spooked by refinery outages across Russia due to Ukranian drone attacks. In the Middle East, traders are increasingly worried that Iran-backed Houthis could be several steps away from targeting Saudi refineries. And now it should make a whole lot of sense why the Biden administration pleaded with Ukrainians to stop drone attacks, along with the White House pushing Vice President Kamala Harris out on ABC News on Sunday to warn Israel publicly not to launch a counteroffensive against Hamas in Rafah - because increased chaos on that side of the world would stoke higher crude prices - and bad timing for the administration, just ahead of the US presidential election in November.Â\xa0\n\n\n Devin Gladden, a spokesperson for AAA, which tracks gasoline prices, warned higher pump prices will force the working poor to make "lifestyle changes and be a focus in November\'s presidential election." Higher pump prices will also make Americans realize how much Bidenomics has failed.Â\xa0 Higher pump prices will also complicate the Fed\'s fight against the inflation monster and likely delay rate cuts this summer, which would undoubtedly upset markets.Â\xa0 This comes as the administration is trying to refill the nation\'s Strategic Petroleum Reserves after releasing a record amount to control last year\'s summertime gasoline price surge.Â\xa0 Since the administration is busy refilling reserves, it has exhausted some of its war chest to control price spikes this spring and summer.Â\xa0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT "If pump prices keep rising, SPR refills will stop automatically. While one cannot rule out another SPR release, the real sleeper risk is the Biden administration would revive threats to restrain US gasoline and diesel exports, especially if a storm disrupted refining capacity. The market, policy, and geopolitical implications of restricting product exports would dwarf those of the LNG pause. Supersize it and add fries," Scott Modell, CEO at Rapidan Energy Advisors, wrote in a statement.Â\xa0'
 'After months of skepticism, traders seem to have finally realized that OPEC+ is serious about keeping crude oil supply constrained. Per the latest weekly data from Reuters, asÂ\xa0reportedÂ\xa0by market analyst John Kemp, traders are buying oil at the fastest rate since 2020. And oil prices are on the rise.\n\n\n Of course, OPEC is not the only factor behind the change in sentiment among traders. Refinery disruptions in Russia resulting from Ukrainian drone attacks have also had a lot to do with the growing bullishness on oil markets. RecentÂ\xa0reportsÂ\xa0that the U.S. had urged the Ukrainians to stop targeting Russian refineries and the Ukrainians\' refusal to do so probably reinforced the effect, too. There is also the improvement in analysts\' outlooks for the global economy. The picture seems to no longer be as bleak as it was last year, so oil demand projections are improving. A month ago, the International Monetary FundÂ\xa0revisedÂ\xa0upwards its forecast for the global economy,Â\xa0and so didÂ\xa0S&P Global Market Intelligence. So traders are once again buying oil in significant volumes. According to the Reuters numbers, in the week ending March 19, traders bought the equivalent of 140 million barrels across the six most traded crude and fuel contracts. Crude was the most bought, with 57 million barrels inÂ\xa0West Texas IntermediateÂ\xa0changing hands during that week along with 55 million barrels ofÂ\xa0Brent crude.  Related: Mexicoâ\x80\x99s Oil Giant Delays Platform Repairs Despite Methane Leaks "Escalating geopolitical tension, coupled with a rise in attacks on energy facilities in Russia and Ukraine, alongside receding ceasefire hopes in the Middle East, raised concern over global oil supply," Nissan Securities analyst Hiroyuki KikukawaÂ\xa0toldÂ\xa0Reuters in comments on the latest movements in prices. Yet while geopolitical factors play a big role in day-to-day price swings, the OPEC+ cuts normally have a longer-term effectâ\x80\x94once it kicks in, and this time, it took a while. Saudi Arabia first announced in July that it would reduce the amount of oil it supplies to global markets. Some saw it as insignificant, while others dismissed it as a desperate attempt to prop up the unproppable as prices remained stubbornly stuck within a narrow range below $80 per barrel.\n\n\n Yet later, the rest of OPEC and its Russia-led partners also joined the Saudisâ\x80\x94and prices still remained locked in their range. The factors that kept them there were the same that are now fueling the rally: a pessimistic outlook for the global economy, geopolitical tensions that weren\'t affecting oil supply, and general skepticism about demand in the era of the energy transition. The tide only began to turn this year as the outlook for global GDP began to change, with the first data about 2023 starting to come in. In some places, things were as bad as they seemed, such as the eurozone. In other parts of the world, however, such as the United States, the economy performed better than most expected, sparking hope that this year could be better still. And that shifted traders\' attention from demand to supply. There had been warnings about shrinking oil inventories amid the OPEC+ cuts but those got little attention until the change in economic outlook. Now, there\'s suddenly concern about a deficit that even the IEA acknowledged, after a month ago confidently stating that the oil market was comfortably supplied. So now prices are on the rise again and Morgan Stanley has alreadyÂ\xa0forecastÂ\xa0that Brent will hit $90 per barrel later in the year. "Every month that OPEC discipline remains in-place, Brent flat price will likely continue to catch up with where inventories and time spreads already are," the bank said. It\'s safe to say that OPEC discipline will remain in place for quite a while yet.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT'
 'A twin crisis is unfolding for the administration as the Ukrainian military bombs key crude refineries deep within Russian territory with suicide drones. The administration has pleaded with the Ukranians to halt strikes on Russian energy infrastructure as this will only contribute to tightening global supplies and push energy prices higher, as well as inflation in the US, hurting Biden\'s re-election odds.Â\xa0 Now for the other crisis that\'s unfolding in the Middle East: US Vice President Kamala Harris told ABC\'s "This Week" that a major attack on the Gazan city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have sought refuge, "would be a huge mistake."Â\xa0\n\n\n "We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake," Harris said. She added: "I have studied the maps - there\'s nowhere for those folks to go. And we\'re looking at about a million and a half people in Rafah who are there because they were told to go there." Harris was asked whether there would be "consequences" from the US on an Israeli counteroffensive in Rafah. She responded, "I am ruling out nothing." This comes as The Jerusalem Post said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials say an operation into the southern Gazan city is "imminent."Â\xa0 Bloomberg quoted Israeli intelligence that estimate about 5,000 to 8,000 Hamas fighters are in Rafah.Â\xa0 As we\'ve explained before, in the note titled "Terrified" Joe Biden Demands Ukraine Halt Strikes On Russian Refiners As It Is Sending Oil Prices Surging," Biden\'s foreign policy has been and always been about crude markets.Â\xa0 So, of course, the administration would march the clueless VP onto ABC yesterday to give Irasel a public warning about the consequences of launching a counteroffensive against Hamas in Rafah, because it\'s not entirely about the poor Palestinians, but the prospect of a much wider conflict that could send crude prices into parabolic trajectories, thus reigniting US inflation and continuing to weigh on re-election odds.Â\xa0\n\n\n Rapidan Energy Group wrote in a recent note that the "Axis of Resistance" (Iranian proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen) is "likely to intensify its attacks as Israel moves forward with the ground offensive in Rafah."Â\xa0Â\xa0 "Israel would likely wait until the IDF consolidates control over Rafah and the Philadelphia corridor before risking a major confrontation with Hezbollah," Rapidan noted.Â\xa0 An invasion of Rafah could be the beginning of a series of dominoes that spark several powder kegs in the region that would put US troops at risk once again. Recall when three US Army troops were killed and more than 30 injured in a drone attack in Jordan earlier this year. A restart of these types of attacks is at high risk after Israel attacks Rafah.Â\xa0 Last month, Rapidan raised its odds of a major Israeli military offensive in Lebanon from 30% to 40%. However, they "expect overall Israel-Hezbollah tensions will remain contained and that a diplomatic agreement will avert a major conflict."Â\xa0 Given these mounting uncertainties in the Middle East and Russia, it\'s only a matter of time before traders focus their attention on the Saudi Aramco Abqaiq Plants (read: "The Weaponization Of Crude Could Trigger The Next Financial Shock"), the largest crude stabilization plant in the world, as it could be in the crosshairs of Iran-backed Houthis.Â\xa0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT Crude markets are starting to pay attention as war risk premiums are being priced in.Â\xa0'
 'A key reason why oil prices have remained relatively subdued despite the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars is that Iran has been producing much more oil than widely known, with the tacit agreement of the U.S. This acquiescence stems from the White Houseâ\x80\x99s desire to avoid the sort of surging energy prices that caused inflation and interest rates to spike in it and its key allies in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, risking economic recessions in several of them. It also comes from the political awareness that rising oil prices cause gasoline prices to rise as well, and this directly affects a sitting U.S. presidentâ\x80\x99s chances of re-election, as analysed in full inÂ\xa0my new book on the new global oil market order. This massive additional quantity of oil from Iran over and above the official figures has gone to China for a basic discount of 30 percent minimum to the relevant grade benchmarks, which has reduced Chinaâ\x80\x99s demand for oil in the open market and has consequently acted as a dampening factor on global oil prices. The reason why it does not show up in any official figures is that these â\x80\x98unofficialâ\x80\x99 oil flows from Iran are held by China in â\x80\x98bonded storageâ\x80\x99, and oil that goes into bonded storage is not put through Chinaâ\x80\x99s General Administration of Customs (GAC) â\x80\x93 it is not even recorded as having been â\x80\x98paid forâ\x80\x99 - and consequently does not appear on any GAC documentation. Much of these unofficial flows have come from increases in the oil fields shared between Iran and Iraq, so it is little wonder that both countries are working now to dramatically increase these further. There are many shared fields between the two countries, but the most notable ones are Azadegan (on the Iran side)/Majnoon (on the Iraq side), Azar (Iran)/Badra (Iraq), Yadavaran (Iran)/Sinbad (Iraq), Naft Shahr (Iran)/Naft Khana (Iraq), Dehloran (Iran)/Abu Ghurab (Iraq), West Paydar (Iran)/Fakka/Fauqa (Iraq), and Arvand (Iran)/South Abu Ghurab (Iraq). The new development initiative between Iran and Iraq will see predominantly local companies, many of which are closely affiliated to Iranâ\x80\x99s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) or its Iraqi proxies, tasked with increasing the oil recovery yield from the smaller shared fields, while Russian and Chinese companies take the lead on the bigger fields. The idea behind using the local firms for the smaller fields is to allow them to develop their oil recovery techniques (with help from Russia and China) so that they can consistently average more than the 3.5 percent recovery rates that they have so far managed on sites they have been assigned. Just before sanctions were re-introduced on Iran in 2018, by comparison, a well-known Western oil firm produced a feasible plan to increase the recovery rates on a group of these smaller fields to over 12.5 percent within 12 months from starting (from the then-2.5 percent average), 20 percent a year after that, and then to around 50 percent within three years from then. The hope in Iranâ\x80\x99s Petroleum Ministry is that by increasing the technical abilities of these local companies, they can be increasingly involved with developing the bigger fields, which would enable the Islamic Republic to reduce the discount on oil sold to China as part of the overall field development packages signed with its companies.\n\n\n The same hope is held for the bigger fields too, and the financial potential from even relatively small increases in the oil recovery rate are massive. Looking at just the shared fields in the exceptionally oil-rich cluster of fields in the West Karoun area - which comprises the fields of North Azadegan, South Azadegan, North Yaran, South Yaran, and Yadavaran, for example - these are conservatively estimated to contain at least 67 billion barrels of oil in place and, even more propitiously, have an average recovery rate currently of just 5 percent. This compares to average recovery rate across Saudi Arabia of at least 50 percent. â\x80\x9cFor every one percent increase in the average rate of recovery across West Karoun, the recoverable reserves figure would increase by 670 million barrels, or around US$34 billion in revenues, even if we were only to sell at US$50 a barrel,â\x80\x9d the Iran source toldÂ\xa0OilPrice.com. â\x80\x9cWith the right joint development, an increase in recovery rate across the [West Karoun] sites to at least 25 percent over a 20-year contract period could be expected to add US$838 billion in revenues for Iran,â\x80\x9d he added. Currently, West Karounâ\x80\x99s oil output averages around 360,000 barrels per day (bpd), with spikes to 380,000 bpd, compared to 120,000 bpd in 2017, according to the Iran source. A key part of the all-encompassingÂ\xa0â\x80\x98Iran-China 25-Year Comprehensive Cooperation Agreementâ\x80\x99, as first revealed anywhere in the world in myÂ\xa03 September 2019 articleÂ\xa0on the subject and also analysed in full in my new book on theÂ\xa0new global oil market order, was that Chinese firms increase the collective output from the West Karoun fields by at least 500,000 bpd. This should not be difficult, given that the average US$1-2 lifting cost per barrel of crude oil in Iran â\x80\x93 a proxy for ease of extraction - is the same as in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. So far, though, no meaningful increases have been effected by Chinese firms, which may be another reason why Iran and Iraq want to increase the abilities of their own people in exploiting their enormous oil resources. The shared fields of Iran and Iraq have also been invaluable as the basis for Tehranâ\x80\x99s highly successful efforts over the years to avoid oil sanctions from either the U.S. or Europe. The oil on the non-sanctioned Iraqi side of the border is often drilled from the same reservoirs as the oil drilled on the sanctioned Iranian side, sometimes even through long-distance horizontal directional drilling. Even if the Americans, Europeans, or any of their most trusted appointees stationed people at every single rig in every single shared field in Iraq they would not be able to tell if the oil coming out it was from the Iraq side or the Iranian side. So this has allowed for decades Iranian oil simply to be rebranded at source as Iraqi oil and shipped to wherever is required in the world. Other layers of complexity have been added to this to further obfuscate the true origin of the oil in question, as also analysed in full inÂ\xa0my new book on the new global oil market order. One simple but very effective method is just to switch off a shipâ\x80\x99s automatic identification systemsÂ\xa0(AIS) transponder, making the vessel much more difficult to track. Another involves simply lying about a shipâ\x80\x99s final destination in the freight documentation and in the vesselâ\x80\x99s voyage plan. This standard Iranian sanctions-avoidance measure was openly acknowledged in 2020 by its former Petroleum Minister, Bijan Zanganeh, when he said: â\x80\x9cWhat we export is not under Iranâ\x80\x99s name. The documents are changed over and over, as well as [the] specifications.â\x80\x9d Additionally, transfers at sea in territorial waters of Malaysia and Indonesia have proven another popular way for Iran to move oil ultimately to China. As Iranâ\x80\x99s then-Foreign Minister, Mohammad Zarif, stated in December 2018 at the Doha Forum: â\x80\x9cIf there is an art that we have perfected in Iran, [that] we can teach to others for a price, it is the art of evading sanctions.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0Â\xa0In any event, following the recent meeting of Iranâ\x80\x99s Petroleum Minister, Javad Owji, and his Iraqi counterpart, Hayan Abdel-Ghani, the development of these shared oil fields is to be expedited, with further meetings scheduled in the coming month to task individual local firms with new awards to do so. These discussions will also include finalising corollary details such as the further development of required infrastructure, methods to move money related to these developments, and how to monetise gas produced at the oil fields, according to the Iran source.'
 'Last October, I published a piece on OilPrice where I discussed the drivers for the rapid expansion of upstream E&P merger activity that was being seen. Upstream M&A has continued since that article came out, and I thought an update was in order as not only has it continued, but seems to have reached a fever pace in recent weeks. In just the last three months we have had news from Chord Energy, (NYSE:CHRD) merging with Bakken focused, Canadian operator Enerplus, (NYSE:ERF). In a long overdue consolidation in the natural gas space, Chesapeake Energy and Southwestern Energy have agreed to a merger of equals. Just last week, leading gas producer EQT Corp, (NYSE:EQT) announced its intention to acquire Equitrans, (NYSE:ETRN). As I said, a fever pace. In this article we will review our thinking from last October and provide new information from various sources that highlight underlying resource drivers for continued upstream M&A as 2024 ages. Production peaking later this decade\n\n\n Last week at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, ConocoPhillps CEO, Ryan Lance forecast that U.S. production would advance to about 14 mm BOPD a few years hence, and then plateau. He was quoted in an SP Global article- "Probably later this decade we\'ll see US production plateau and will probably stay there a long time," he said. "I don\'t know that we\'ll get to 15 [million b/d], but I think we\'ll pass through 14 million [b/d] on the way to 15 million [b/d].â\x80\x9d For this year, Lance thought, â\x80\x9cUS crude oil production growth in 2024 will likely drop to about 300,000-400,000 b/d in 2024, down from around 1 million b/d in 2023.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0 This viewpoint matches fairly well with my own, although I must admit I have been surprised with the impact that drilling and completions technology has had on enabling production growth in the face of rig count declines. One way to measure the impact of longer laterals, increased frac intensity, and well spacing is through the change in output per rig. As measured by the EIA-DPR (Drilling Productivity Report), from March of 2019 the average daily output per Permian rig has increased from 624 BOPD per rig, to 1,359 BOPD per rig. Normalized for the decline in rig count from 465 to 316 in this basin, thatâ\x80\x99s still a 60% increase in output. The â\x80\x9cRed Queenâ\x80\x9d effect Now we are nearing the peak of the arc where growth comes in 5-10 BOPM increments instead of the 50-60 BOPM gains we saw from Jul-22-Dec-23. Eventually, unless drilling increases, or new technologies come along-not out of the question, the legacy decline factor-this month -422K BOPM, will exceed new oil production-currently 430K BOPM. When that happens, the curve will bend down, as noted in the graph below.Â\xa0  This is referred to in shale professional circles as The Red Queen effect, referring to a scene in Lewis Carrollâ\x80\x99s Through the Looking Glass where Alice learns from the Red Queen that she must run increasingly fast just to stay in the same place. This has turned out to be a fairly apt metaphor for shale production. A report from energy analyst firm, Enervus, to this effect was summarized in a Journal of Petroleum Technology article August, 16th of last year. Dane Gregoris, report author and managing director at Enervus Intelligence Research, was quoted as saying. â\x80\x9cThe US shale industry has been massively successful, roughly doubling the production out of the average oil well over the last decade, but that trend has slowed in recent years. The production decline rate has grown steeper at a rate of more than 0.5% annually since 2010. Weâ\x80\x99ve observed that decline curves, meaning the rate at which production falls over time, are getting steeper as well density increases. Summed up, the industryâ\x80\x99s treadmill is speeding up and this will make production growth more difficult than it was in the past.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0 Or it could be sooner\n\n\n As Mr. Lance opined, shale output may bend the curve in the next decade. Some believe that could happen later this year. The graph above from this monthâ\x80\x99s EIA-DPR illustrates that YoY legacy declines are accelerating in all shale plays, most notably in the Permian. In contrast to the point of view expressed by Mr. Lance, natural resources analyst firm Goerhring & Rosencwajg, put out a bulletin in the third quarter of last year with a much closer time-horizon, based on declines acreage quality and the fact that you can only let air out of a balloon for so long. â\x80\x9cWe now calculate the Permian has also produced half of its reserves and expect sequential growth to turn negative within the next few months. With a growing degree of confidence, we expect 2024 will be the peak in Permian production. Over the last fifteen years, the US shales have represented all non-OPEC growth. In the previous five years, the Permian has dominated US shales. If correct, we are entering an unprecedented period of tightness in global oil markets.â\x80\x9d With this imminent plateauing of U.S. shale, should G&R be correct, the focus of the conversation in regard to shale output shifts toward the length of the â\x80\x9ctail.â\x80\x9d A metaphor for the slope of the decline that will be seen as more and more wells are completed in the future. Here McKinsey notes in their 2024 Outlook on Oil that â\x80\x9cshale production could plateau in the mid-2020s at about ten million barrels per day and remain stable through 2040.â\x80\x9d That is a fairly long tail in my view, and buttresses investments in U.S. shale drillers. As we will discuss in the closing commentary in this article, the M&A activity we have seen over the last couple of years is clearly hinged on the idea espoused by McKinsey that decades of useful life remain in shale plays, even if they do decline. Your takeaway One thing that is certain is that the larger companies with deep pockets have decided to pad their long term productivity in shale plays by buying out the best of the relatively smaller players, public and private. 2023 was a banner year for M&A activity with about $234 bn in deal-making, as noted in a recent Offshore Technology article.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT As RBN Energy noted in their February, 5th blog post, Keep On Dancing, this wave of upstream E&P consolidation was likely to continue. â\x80\x9dThe huge wave of 2023 consolidation has taken out several of the major potential targets, especially in the Permian. However, the drivers of crude oil consolidation remain and there are strong prospects for future major deals this year, especially in other plays such as the Bakken, Mid-Continent, and Gulf of Mexico.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0 If that scenario continues to play out this year, we are likely to see further capex declines that impact drilling and completions as these companies combine forces and then root out wasteful duplication. The twin forces of stubbornly low prices in natural gas, and oscillating prices for WTI, combined with increasing demand by investors for capital returns, have had the effect of many upstream companies curtailing capex for 2024. Maximizing free cash flow to fund shareholder capital returns-dividends and stock repurchases, have clearly taken priority over increased capex for production growth.Â\xa0 This message has been consistent across a broad swath of shale producers that include Occidental Petroleum, (NYSE:OXY)-down 9% YoY, Devon Energy, (NYSE:DVN)-down 7% YoY, and Diamondback Energy, (NYSE:FANG), down 11% YoY. In summary. The natural forces of legacy declines in older shale wells, combined with reservoirs that are approaching, or have passed their halfway point of ultimate recovery, will meet capital restraint and result in a plateauing of shale output as early as this year. This will exert a tightening force on the oil market, which should be supportive for prices and the stock prices of E&P operators. If we do indeed see a sign that these declines are accelerating to the point where production actually declines, I would expect a robust impact on the stock prices of these companies almost immediately.'
 'UK oil major Wood Group is set to cut hundreds of jobs as it prepares to release its 2023 annual results, reports suggest. According to Sky News, the London-listed oil major is eyeing up the axeing of 200 positions from its 36,000-strong employee base.\n\n\n The firm employs roughly 6,500 in the UK, the majority of whom are based in Aberdeen. The news comes nearly a year after a rumoured Â£1.7bn takeover by private equity giant Apollo Management was culled, with the investment group saying that it would make no further offers. The news wiped 35 per cent off Wood Groupâ\x80\x99s share price and it still lingers around 32 per cent lower than its position before the announcement. It is due to report full-year earnings for 2023 next week. The Scottish engineering giant generated Â£2.2bn ($2.9bn) in revenue over the first six months of the period â\x80\x93 up around 15 per cent year-on-year â\x80\x93 and profits before tax of of Â£149m ($195m), which is a six per cent boost over the same trading period for 2022. The group is one of the embattled group of UK-based oil majors that will have to continue to weather the battering taken from the governmentâ\x80\x99s windfall tax.\n\n\n Chancellor Jeremy Hunt extended the profits levy by another year in his Spring Budget speech and even told morning TV stations the day after that it was fair to classify the oil and gas sector as the Budgetâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9closersâ\x80\x9d. Woodâ\x80\x99s North Sea compatriot Harbour Energy, whose chief executive has damned the windfall tax and its effect on energy companies in the past, said earlier this month that its 2023 revenue fell 31 per cent from $5.4bn (Â£4.2bn) to $3.7bn (Â£2.9bn). Harbourâ\x80\x99s profit before tax fell 75 per cent to $597m (Â£468.5m), with a post-tax profit of $32m (Â£25.1m), up from $8m (Â£6.2m) in 2022.

 "Crude oil futures have rallied close to a five-month high with concerns about tightening supplies driving up prices in recent days, only coming down to earth on Wednesday and paring some of those gains while awaiting an interest rate signal from the U.S. Federal Reserve.Â\xa0Â\xa0Â\xa0 According toÂ\xa0StoneXÂ\xa0energy analyst Alex Hodes, Ukraine's recent attacks on Russian refineriesÂ\xa0could potentially cutÂ\xa0~350K bbl/day of global petroleum supplies and boost U.S. crude prices by $3/bbl. Analysts at J.P. MorganÂ\xa0estimates that 900K barrels of Russian refinery capacity have gone offline after the attacks,Â\xa0adding a risk premium of $4/bblÂ\xa0to oil prices. Brent futures have extended their year-to-date gain to nearly $10 per barrel (bbl) to trade at $85.93 at 1145 hrs ET in Wednesdayâ\x80\x99s session while WTI crude has gained 13.8% YTD to $81.66/bbl.\n\n\n Also supporting crude prices is stronger-than-expected demand with commodity analysts at Standard Chartered noting that energy markets kicked off the new year with an overly pessimistic view of oil demand. Following the release of the latest Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI)Â\xa0report on Monday, StanChart estimates that January demand clocked in at 100.24 million barrels per day (mb/d), good for a 2.67 mb/d year-over-year increase. Related: Saudi Aramco To Expand Natural Gas Output Capacity by 60% That figure is 0.25 mb/d higher than StanChartâ\x80\x99s latest forecast, a development that has prompted the analysts to revise their 2024 demand growth forecast to 1.69 mb/d from 1.64 mb/d previously. The analysts have also predicted we are going to see a sustained period of inventory draws in H1-2024, with the cumulative draw during the first half of the year coming in at 185 mb compared with a H1-2023 build of 230 mb. StanChart says demand indications remain robust, and have predicted that global demand will hit a new all-time high of 103.01 mb/d in May, a record which will be broken in June and again in August when demand is expected to clock in at 103.62 mb/d and 104.31 mb/d, respectively.Â\xa0 StanChart has predicted that tightening oil markets will continue to power the oil price rally and has reiterated its long-held forecast for Brent to average $94/bbl in Q2-2024. Supply Constraints StanChart has predicted that oil markets will continue to be supply-constrained for the better part of the year. The analysts see limited growth for U.S. crude production, with U.S. supply not likely to move significantly higher than November 2023â\x80\x99s all-time high of 13.319 mb/d. Meanwhile, Russia will continue to struggle to optimize its upstream and downstream oil system, with logistical constraints due toÂ\xa0 war damage as well as a lack of critical spare parts contributing to a negative outlook for Russian crude and refined products output.Â\xa0\n\n\n More importantly, StanChart sees OPEC+ having ample room to maneuver starting in the third quarter. The analysts have pointed out that a 0.9 mb/d increase in OPEC output in the third quarter would still lead to an inventory draw of 0.5 mb/d for the quarter on top of the 1 mb/d draw across H1-2024. Indeed, OPEC has room to increase Q3 output by as much as 1.5 mb/d Q/Q without increasing inventories. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is the most bearish of the leading energy agencies; however, using its model, OPEC could increase output by 0.8 mb/d Q/Q without triggering an inventory build. StanChart notes that Q3 crude balances are such that OPEC could significantly increase crude output without depressing prices or negatively affecting inventories. Unfortunately, the mid-term natural gas outlook remains bearish. The latest JODI oil and gas data release showed a modest recovery in European natural gas demand, with gas demand in France increasing 5.5% Y/Y in January; +4.1% in the UK, +4.3% in Italy and +13.2% in Spain. Germany was the main exception after recording a 3.6% Y/Y fall in demand. Still, Europeâ\x80\x99s gas demand remains well below January 2022 levels, with demand in France 15.4% lower compared to levels two years ago; -9.9% in the UK, -9.7% in Germany, -19.4% in Italy and -20.2% in Spain. Itâ\x80\x99s highly unlikely that the situation will change soon with inventories already starting to build up in Germany and Italy before the withdrawal season is even over. The latestÂ\xa0 Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE)Â\xa0dataÂ\xa0shows that EU inventories stood at 69.70 billion cubic meters (bcm) on 17 March, good for aÂ\xa0 5.58 bcm Y/Y increase and 21.39bcm above the five-year average. That said, European gas prices have posted a strong rally despite record-high inventories, partly due to a reduction in LNG exports from the Freeport, Texas, terminal and also partly due to renewed market concerns about the supply security of the remaining flows of Russian gas into Europe. Front-month Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas gained EUR 3.892 per megawatt hour (MWh) w/w to hit a one-month high of EUR 28.822/MWh on 18 March.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT"
 'Until recently, large oil companies tended to stay quiet when governments and activists urged them to accelerate the transition from their products to alternative energy sources. Now, this is changing. And it is changing radically. At this week\'s CERAWeek conference in Houston, this change was especially visible, with several top executives openly calling for a rethink of the transition and caution in the rush to give up oil and gasâ\x80\x94which is unlikely to happen anytime soon.\n\n\n Unsurprisingly, Aramco\'s Amin Nasser was especially blunt, saying, "We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas, and instead invest in them adequately," asÂ\xa0quotedÂ\xa0by Reuters. Nasser added that wind and solar are yet to prove themselves as adequate replacements for oil and gas in terms of cost. Nasser was not pulling any punches, pointing out that oil demand, whose demise has been predicted repeatedly, was going to once again hit a record this year despite those predictions. Indeed, the International Energy Agency, the most prominent outlet making the demise predictions, has now regularly had to revise its oil demand forecasts almost every month in the past couple of years. It seems that oil demand may continue to grow at a similar pace in the coming years as well. In fact, another oil executive just warned that energy demand globally is set to increase faster than population growth, meaning that oil demand is nowhere near peaking by 2030. "The world population is going to increase by about 25% between now and 2050, but energy demand will increase faster than that," Sheikh Nawaf al-Sabah, the chief executive of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, said at CERAWeek, as quoted by CNBC. He was responding to a question about the IEA\'s peak oil demand prediction.  Related: Oil Supported By Crude, Gasoline Draws Al-Sabah added that "The global south will be a large component of energy demand in the future. And it\'s only fair to have countries that have â\x80\x93 to use a term â\x80\x93 energy poverty, be able to exploit natural resources in a clean and efficient manner." The comment echoes statements made by African leaders who have slammed the West for preventing their countries from exploiting their energy resources by withholding finance from international lenders such as the IMF and the World Bank. Private banks in Europe and North America are also reluctant to finance oil and gas projects in Africa, but they are leaving no vacuum. Chinese lenders are happilyÂ\xa0stepping inÂ\xa0to fund oil and gas production in African countries. The African resource question seems like one that is going to continue garnering growing attention. Africa contains much of the untapped oil and gas resources of the world, and it is difficult to argue with the claim that the West has no moral right to insist African countries skip the oil and gas phase to move straight to wind and solar, which are incompatible with industrialization.\n\n\n So is the opposition to a rushed transition. Executives at CERAWeek are now openly warning against moving too quickly and applying some caution in the desired switch from oil and gas to full electrification. A very on-point comment came from Woodside Energy\'s Meg O\'Neill, who said, as quoted by Reuters, that "It has become emotional. And when things are emotional, it becomes more difficult to have a pragmatic conversation." Indeed, there is a lot of emotion in transition conversations, and this has not been productive. It was because of this focus on emotionsâ\x80\x94fear of an apocalyptic future around the cornerâ\x80\x94that some major problems with wind and solar remained overlooked for quite a long time, only emerging recently to haunt the industries. Take wind\'s stock market crisis from last year as it emerged that wind energy is not exactly as cheap as advertised and that it cannot be as cheap as advertised because developers won\'t make any money from it. Then there was the slowing uptake of solar as some governments began to phase out subsidies, suggesting that it, too, was probably not quite as cheap as advertised. Naturally, none of these statements will be taken seriously by politicians who have declared their complete support for the transition. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm\'s reaction to the above statements was a good illustration. "That is one opinion," Granholm said in comments on Aramco\'s of Nasser\'s forecast for oil demand. "There have been other studies that suggest the opposite that oil and gas demand and fossil demand will peak by 2030."\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT Those other studies are the IEA report that Nasser referred to originally, pointing out the prediction of peak demand focused on Western nations while the big driver of additional demand will be the developing world. Even for Western nations, however, it is difficult to imagine peak oil demand in less than ten years. The average per-capital consumption of oil in the U.S. is 22 barrels annually, versus less than 2 barrels annually for developing countries. Giving up such energy abundance would be quite difficultâ\x80\x94and wind, solar, and EVs cannot provide it.'
 'Crude oil prices were trading lower today after the Energy Information Administration reportedÂ\xa0that U.S. crude oil inventories had shed 2 million barrels in the week to March 15, with gasoline stocks also declining. The crude oil inventory change compared withÂ\xa0a draw of 1.5 million barrelsÂ\xa0for the previous week, which also featured a substantial inventory decline in gasoline inventories.\n\n\n Gasoline inventories fell by 3.3 million barrels in the week to March 15, with production averaging 9.6 barrels daily. This compared with a draw of 5.7 million barrels and production of 9.9 million barrels daily a week earlier. Middle distillate inventories added a modest 600,000 barrels in the week to March 15, with production standing at an average daily of 4.7 million barrels. These figures compared with an inventory build of 900,000 barrels for the previous week, when production averaged 4.6 million barrels daily. Oil prices, meanwhile, continue combing higher amid growing concern about global fuel supply amid drone attack disruptions in Russian refining activity.Â\xa0Brent crudeÂ\xa0was trading above $87 per barrel earlier today, withÂ\xa0West Texas IntermediateÂ\xa0topping $83 per barrel. At the time of writing, both benchmarks were down by close to 2% each as traders took profit and a stronger dollar suggested demand weakening. A string of drone attacks carried out by Ukrainian forces on Russian refineries have idled several hundred thousand barrels in daily refining capacity although estimates vary considerably.\n\n\n Reuters, for instance,Â\xa0estimatesÂ\xa0the shut-in capacity at a little over 300,000 barrels daily, while Gunvor hasÂ\xa0estimatedÂ\xa0the effect at 600,000 bpd in capacity. JP Morgan is even more dramatic, estimating the affected capacity at 900,000 barrels daily. A decline in oil exports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq also contributed to higher prices, Reuters reported earlier in the day, citing UBS commodity strategist Giovanni Staunovo as noting that "Oil demand data surprising on the positive side and the extension of the voluntary OPEC+ cuts until the end of June have supported prices."'
 'Many tech analysts have accused the oil industry of being too slow to adopt new technology. Yet the industry is itself the source of much technological progress in its narrow, specialized field. Over the past ten years, however, oil and gas have started to open up for digital technology and automation. In fact, the energy industry has very much embraced all things digital and AI. And now, these technologies are helping it produce more oil and gas for less money.\n\n\n Bloomberg recentlyÂ\xa0reportedÂ\xa0how the oil industry was using artificial intelligence to improve drilling in the shale patch and boost the recovery rates of fracked wells. This is quite an important step for the industry, which until quite recently appeared to prefer to use the power of computers for things like seismic surveys and pipeline monitoring. Back in 2018, a KPMG survey found that many oil and gas companies were already adopting artificial intelligence or planning to adopt it soon. Of course, at the time, â\x80\x9cartificial intelligenceâ\x80\x9d usually referred to tech such as predictive analytics and machine learning, and yet it was proving helpful enough to merit the attention of oil executives. â\x80\x9cTechnology is disrupting the status quo in the oil and gas industry. AI and robotic solutions can help us create models that will predict behavior or outcomes more accurately, like improving rig safety, dispatching crews faster, and identifying systems failures even before they arise,â\x80\x9d said one of the authors of the survey, KPMGâ\x80\x99s Global Sector Head for Energy and Natural Resources in the United States,Â\xa0said at the time in comments on the findings.  Related: U.S. Oil, Gas Activity Picks Up But Slow Start to the Year All this is still true and digital technology is being used ever more widely in the energy industry. The U.S. shale patch is a natural early adopter because production costs there tend to be generally higher than they are in conventional oil and gas drilling. But thanks to tech, these costs are coming down as drilling times accelerateâ\x80\x94and accuracy is improving too. Bloomberg noted in its recent report that technology had helped shale drillers shorten the average period for drilling a new well by a whole day and the period for fracking that well by three days. A day saved is a dayâ\x80\x99s costs saved. Then there is the drilling of longer horizontal wells that last year contributed significantly to higher-than-expected well productivity in the shale patch. And it would not have been possible without digital technology. According to Evercore ISI, AI and other tech could bring costs in the shale patch down by double digits as soon as this year. â\x80\x9cThereâ\x80\x99ll be significant cost savings, at a minimum double digits, but probably in the 25% to 50% of cost savings in certain scenarios,â\x80\x9d Evercore analyst James West told Bloomberg. These are some significant cost savings, for sure. And if they do materialize, they would certainly enable higher productionâ\x80\x94if the industry develops an appetite for it. This used to be the natural order of things: whenever drillers found a cheaper way to drill, that was what they did, boosting production.\n\n\n Now, times are somewhat different. Oil and gas companies do plan for higher productionâ\x80\x94but within limits as they continue to prioritize shareholder returns and capital discipline. Yet digital tech adoption will likely intensifyâ\x80\x94because it can apparently help oil and gas companies meet their climate-related targets. Right now, there is a campaign gathering speed against methane emissions. Just an afterthought a few years ago when everyone focused on CO2, methane has now become a public climate enemy in its own right because of its more powerful, though shorter-lived, greenhouse effect. Methane emission tracking and monitoringâ\x80\x94and ultimately reductionâ\x80\x94is becoming a priority area for the energy industry. This is one area where digital technology would certainly come in handy, especially since it is already used for monitoring and risk assessment. AI and other tech will also come in handy in boosting operational efficiency. Remote drilling and monitoring is a big growth area, and so is equipment failure prediction, which is crucial in this industry. Baker Hughes, for example, boasts it can predict equipment failure for 65% of a clientâ\x80\x99s wells in the Permian. It wants to boost this to 70%, and it probably will before too long. Perhaps most importantly, however, is that AI and the rest of what we collectively call digital tech could help oil and gas with its talent shortage problem. Fewer and fewer college-age people are choosing a career in oil and gas. Thatâ\x80\x99s in large part a result of a concerted effort by climate NGOs to discourage them from choosing such a career and, in part, due to the long-term uncertainty of such a career. Cyclical industries are famous for it. Many young people also apparently dislike the physical demands of oilfield work.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT Yet the tightening embrace between oil and gas and digital technology is attracting a new sort of talent thatÂ\xa0does not mind workingÂ\xa0in the oil and gas industry as long as that work is conducted in an office and not the field. The adoption of things like AI, automation, and predictive analytics is changing the reputation of oil and gasâ\x80\x94and for the better this time. And it is changing the industry itself.'
 'In mid-December, I wrote here that the U.S. had set a new annual oil production record: Â\xa0\n\n\n â\x80\x9cThe U.S. set a new annual oil production record on December 15, based on data from the Energy Information Administration. Although the official monthly numbers from the EIA wonâ\x80\x99t be released for a couple of months, we can calculate that a new record has been set based on the following analysis.â\x80\x9d I could project that new record based on the weekly production numbers from the EIA, but I noted that official confirmation wouldnâ\x80\x99t come until sometime this year. On March 11, 2024, the EIA made it official: United States produces more crude oil than any country, ever. The EIA analysis notes that not only did the U.S. break the previous record in 2023, but speculated that no other nation is likely to break it any time soon: â\x80\x9cThe United States produced more crude oil than any nation at any time, according to our International Energy Statistics, for the past six years in a row. Crude oil production in the United States, including condensate, averaged 12.9 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2023, breaking the previous U.S. and global record of 12.3 million b/d, set in 2019. Average monthly U.S. crude oil production established a monthly record high in December 2023 at more than 13.3 million b/d. The crude oil production record in the United States in 2023 is unlikely to be broken in any other country in the near term because no other country has reached production capacity of 13.0 million b/d. Saudi Arabiaâ\x80\x99s state-owned Saudi Aramco recently scrapped plans to increase production capacity to 13.0 million b/d by 2027.â\x80\x9d The EIA analysis noted that following nearly 40 years of annual production declines, in 2009, U.S. crude oil production experienced a resurgence, attributed to the widespread adoption of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques by producers. Since then, production has continued to climb steadily. The only interruption to this growth occurred in 2020 and 2021, when demand and prices plummeted due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, recent increases in total crude oil and natural gas production in the United States have been primarily driven by the growth of production in the Permian Basin, located in western Texas and eastern New Mexico.\n\n\n The worldâ\x80\x99s three largest oil producers â\x80\x94 the U.S., Russia, and Saudi Arabia â\x80\x94 accounted for 40% of the worldâ\x80\x99s oil production in 2023:  Global Oil Production in 2023 by Select Countries. ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION One notable difference between the U.S. and the other two major producers is that Russia and Saudi Arabia still produce far more oil than they consume, making them major net exporters of crude oil. The U.S. is still a net importer of crude oil, but it has been steadily moving toward becoming a net exporter. When only crude oil is considered, the U.S. imported 2.4 million barrels per day (BPD) in 2023. However, that was down from more than 10 million BPD in 2005 and 2006 and was the lowest level since 1972.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. became a net exporter of finished products like diesel and gasoline in 2011. In 2020, the U.S. reached net exporter status on finished products plus crude oil, and in 2023 those net exports grew to 1.6 million BPD. If the U.S. continues to expand oil production, it could become a net exporter of just crude oil by the end of the decade.'
 'President Joe Biden delivered the 2024 State of the Union address last Thursday night under what is always one of the most intense spotlights of the year. This comes as he prepares for a general election campaign against former President Donald Trump. I tuned in briefly, but I donâ\x80\x99t enjoy political theater. Therefore, after the speech was over, I read through the transcript. My primary interest is to see what the speaker said about energy.\n\n\n Given that President Bidenâ\x80\x99s energy policies have come under attack, I felt certain that he would mention that the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any country ever has, which is an incredible achievement. This is primarily due to the shale-enabled oil and gas boom that began nearly 20 years ago. Just this week, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) wrote on the social media site X: â\x80\x9cWelcome 2Pres Bidenâ\x80\x99s America where the fed govt chooses energy dependence over energy DOMINANCE AND INDEPENDENCE.â\x80\x9d Itâ\x80\x99s a common attack against Biden. Donald Trump often says that if he is reelected, we are going to â\x80\x9cDrill! Drill! Drill!â\x80\x9d â\x80\x94 as if we didnâ\x80\x99t produce more oil in 2023 than in any year in U.S. history. Related:Â\xa0The No.1 Energy Stock for 2024 Thus, I thought Biden would highlight record U.S. energy production in the State of the Union address. But he barely mentioned energy at all. The word â\x80\x9coilâ\x80\x9d was only mentioned in the speech once, and that was in the context of ending tax breaks on â\x80\x9cBig Oil.â\x80\x9d Biden didnâ\x80\x99t mention natural gas at all in the speech, and he only mentioned energy three times, and that was always in the context of â\x80\x9cclean energy.â\x80\x9d\n\n\n So, the incredible energy achievements being recorded in the U.S. were completely ignored in the State of the Union address. Why? Keep in mind that the address is a political speech. One of Bidenâ\x80\x99s biggest objectives is to energize his base, and one of the things he campaigned on was addressing climate change. The Biden Administration has targeted the elimination of fossil fuels for energy generation in the U.S. by 2035. He has passed legislation targeted at speeding up the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, and at slowing down or halting fossil fuel development. Related:Â\xa0Forgotten Gas Reserves Could Be A Gamechanger For European Energy Record U.S. oil and gas production are inconvenient facts that run contrary to the administrationâ\x80\x99s stated objectives. Despite the attacks from Republicans, Biden is probably not keen to remind his base that U.S. oil and gas production both continue to grow.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT A second factor may be that Biden knows that record production comes despite his policies, and not because of them. Presidents regularly take credit for things that they had little to do with, but in this case, Bidenâ\x80\x99s policies have been working to thwart continued expansion of oil and gas. As such, it may have been especially disingenuous to take credit for this. Still, President Biden is in a campaign for reelection. Clean energy has contributed to our record energy production, even if it wasnâ\x80\x99t the primary reason. I would have thought, at a minimum Biden would have pointed out the extraordinary achievement of record U.S. energy production. He could have left it up to his critics to point out that it is primarily due to expanding oil and gas production.'
 "Oil prices edged up in Wednesdayâ\x80\x99s sessionÂ\xa0supported by a decline in U.S. crude inventories,Â\xa0Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineriesÂ\xa0and signs of strong demand. According toÂ\xa0weekly dataÂ\xa0by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.5 million barrels to 446.99 million barrels in the week to March 8, marking the fourth consecutive week of draws, while U.S. crudeÂ\xa0processing roseÂ\xa0by 1.9 percentage point to 86.8% utilization. The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported an even bigger crude draw at 5.521 million barrels, a sharp deviation from the consensus of a 0.4 million barrel build. The WTI contract for April delivery was up 2.4% at 12:00 hrs ET to trade at $79.44 per barrel while Brent for May delivery rose 2.2 % to $83.73. Oil prices have traded steadily higher from their December lows but remain quite a distance from their 52-week highs attained in late September when WTI hit $93.68 per barrel while Brent peaked at $94.36. Thankfully, many energy analysts remain bullish on the near-and mid-term outlook--and so do oil and gas producers. Commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have conducted a survey on 44 oil and gas companies and found that hedging activity remains low, a sign that producers believe prices are headed higher.\n\n\n According to StanChart, the size of the oil hedge book has declined 9.6% since their last survey in November and now stands at 395 million barrels (mb). Whereas that figure is 5% above the Q2-2023 record-low, itâ\x80\x99s a good 65% below the Q1-2020 record-high.Â\xa0 Hedge ratios for oil output now stand at 25.0% for 2024 and 2.9% for 2025. The current-year oil hedge ratio is 8.8 percentage-points higher y/y but 30.3 ppt lower than in 2018 and 24.8 ppt lower than at the start of the pandemic in 2020.  Related: Two Countries That Could Break Putin's Gas Grip On Europe The gas markets are not much different, with the size of the gas hedge book having declined 9.9% at 8.27 trillion cubic feet (tcf), a record-low across StanChartâ\x80\x99s 32-quarter sample. Hedge ratios for gas output stand at 35.0% for 2024 and 15.0% for 2025. According to StanChart, the average oil swap currently sits at $74.13 per barrel (bbl) on a WTI basis, a record-high over the past 32 quarters and only ~ 2/bbl lower than the current futures strip for the remainder of 2024. The analysts have revealed that the distribution of 2024 put options is steepest in the USD 64.37-66.40/bbl range with 62% of all put option strikes falling in this range. This means this area is likely to be the most sensitive area in terms of downside risk from gamma hedging effects if the markets go awry. Gamma hedgingÂ\xa0effects do not usually trigger a selloff but can exacerbate it as was the case in the oil markets last May. StanChart has described the oil markets as being in a â\x80\x98show-meâ\x80\x9d mode whereby prices will likely require a period of visibly tightening fundamentals to make a further significant leg higher, a more supportive rates environment, and consistent upward price revisions by key agencies.Â\xa0  Source: Standard Chartered Research Bullish Forecasts\n\n\n The latest forecasts by the leading energy agencies are bullish. The latest OPEC Secretariat report increased its Q2 call on OPEC forecast by 321 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) to 28.53 mb/d, 1.96 mb/d above OPECâ\x80\x99s February output. The report also increased its 2024 demand growth forecast slightly by 2kb/d to 2.247 mb/d but lowered its 2024 U.S. crude oil supply growth forecast by 40 kb/d to 300 kb/d.Â\xa0 Related:Â\xa0This Could Be A Gamechanger For Natural Gas In Europe Meanwhile, over the past three months, the IEA recently increased its 2024 demand growth forecast by 290 kb/d to 1.22 mb/d. StanChart notes that the gap between the OPEC and IEA demand growth forecasts remains too big at >1 mb/d; however, further closing of the gap in the IEAâ\x80\x99s upcoming reportÂ\xa0will be another bullish sign. StanChart has issued a demand growth forecast for 2024 growth at 1.63 mb/d and another 1.43 mb/d growth in 2025 taking the average for 2025 to 104.2mb/d.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, the European gas markets continue to be flush with the commodity as the current withdrawal season draws to a close. According to Gas Infrastructure (GIE) data, Europeâ\x80\x99s gas inventories stood at 70.78 bcm on 10 March, good for a 5.61 bcm Y/Y increase and 21.41 bcm above the five-year average. StanChart has predicted that the continent will finish the withdrawal season with inventory levels above 68 bcm, setting the stage for low summer prices. Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) fell EUR 1.955 per megawatt-hour (MWh) to settle at EUR 24.93/MWh on 11 March;Â\xa0 53% lower y/y and 81% lower than two years ago following Russiaâ\x80\x99s invasion of Ukraine.Â\xa0"
 'The Energy Information Administration reportedÂ\xa0an estimated inventory draw of 1.5 million barrels for the week to March 8. Gasoline stocks also declined while middle distillates inched up. The figuresÂ\xa0comparedÂ\xa0with a crude oil inventory build of 1.4 million barrels for the previous week, with substantial declines in both gasoline and middle distillates for that week.\n\n\n A day before the EIA released its report, the American Petroleum Institute reported inventory draws across both crude and fuels, pushing oil prices higher on Tuesday. Benchmarks continued higher on Wednesday. In gasoline, the EIA estimated an inventory draw of 5.7 million barrels for the week to March 8, which compared with a decline of some 4 million barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production last week averaged 9.9 million barrels daily, which compared with 9.6 million barrels daily for the previous week. In middle distillates, the EIA reported an inventory increase of 900,000 barrels for the week to March 8, with production averaging 4.6 million bpd. These changes compared with an inventory draw of 4.1 million barrels and production averaging 4.3 million barrels daily for the previous week.\n\n\n A day before it released its weekly oil inventory report, the EIAÂ\xa0revisedÂ\xa0its U.S. oil production outlook in its Short-Term Energy Outlook, now expecting stronger growth than earlier. The EIA now expects production to add 260,000 bpd this year, for a total of 13.19 million barrels daily. Thatâ\x80\x99s up from a modest 170,000 bpd growth projection earlier. This should have been bearish for prices, but the EIA also said in its STEO that it saw OPEC production remain constrained while demand strengthened, which would lead to a tighter market beginning as soon as the second quarter of the year. Following this reportâ\x80\x94and the APIâ\x80\x99s inventory estimateâ\x80\x94oil futures were around 2% higher on the day, boosted additionally by expectations of rate cuts by the Fed come summer. These expectations are not based on signals from Fed officials who remain cautious about any rate-cutting commitments especially as inflation ticked higher in February.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT'
 'Governments and private companies worldwide have been exploring the idea of reducing emissions from oil operations by using nuclear energy. There is increasing pressure for oil and gas firms to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to support a global green transition and reduce the effects of climate change on the environment, yet this can be extremely difficult to achieve. Much of the focus has been on retroactive carbon-capture operations, using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. Many environmentalists believe that the retroactive approach does not make a meaningful change and that fossil fuel companies must reduce their production rates, as well as decarbonise operations at the source. In response, companies worldwide are exploring the potential for nuclear energy to power operations to reduce the emissions created during production and processing activities.Â\xa0 While there is a plethora of environmental issues related to fossil fuel production, there is significant potential to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with oil and gas operations. Oil and gas production, transport, and processing contribute around 15 percent of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. The use of oil and gas accounts for another 40 percent of emissions. While it is extremely difficult to reduce these emissions, using clean energy sources to power upstream oil and gas facilities could help companies decarbonise some of their activities.Â\xa0\n\n\n At present, most companies rely on fossil fuels to power upstream operations, such as extracting gas and oil through drilling, pumping, and fracking. Many downstream operations, such as refining and processing, also use fossil fuels. Aline des Cloizeaux, the Director of the International Atomic Energy Agencyâ\x80\x99s (IAEA) Division of Nuclear Power,Â\xa0stated: â\x80\x9cMost oil and gas operations burn fossil fuels to produce the energy needed for their upstream and downstream operations.â\x80\x9d She added, â\x80\x9cTo drive down carbon emissions from these processes, ideally drilling, natural gas liquefaction and refining would be electrified with low carbon sources, such as nuclear.â\x80\x9d Related:Â\xa0Europeâ\x80\x99s Secret Weapon In Its Energy War With Russia Most oil and gas operations are conducted in remote locations, making it difficult to power activities using electricity from the grid. However, there is significant potential to use microreactors (MRs) or small modular reactors (SMRs) to deliver power to the site. While fossil fuel production will still create carbon emissions, the use of nuclear power to fuel operations can help significantly reduce operational emissions and prevent waste. While the MR and SMR industry is in its infancy, many governments and private companies are investing in the acceleration of this technology, with capacity expected to increase significantly by 2030.Â\xa0 One company is taking the next step in using nuclear power to fuel oil and gas operations by signing an agreement to develop the necessary technology. Viaro Energy and newcleo, a clean nuclear technology developer, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to forge a strategic partnership to decarbonise oil and gas infrastructure using nuclear technology. The MoU provides a strategy for decarbonising Viaroâ\x80\x99s oil and gas operations with newcleoâ\x80\x99s lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) technology. Newcleo expects the equipment to be suitable for a range of locations as it is compact and easily transportable. The LFR will be powered using reprocessed spent fuel, produced from existing reactors, to reduce waste.Â\xa0 Stefano Buono, the Chairman and CEO of newcleo,Â\xa0stated: â\x80\x9cThis is an exciting partnership and demonstrates the potential for newcleoâ\x80\x99s technology to support industrial decarbonisation. The transition to net-zero will only be achieved by decarbonising not only the energy, transport and heat sectors but also energy-intensive and â\x80\x98hard to abateâ\x80\x99 heavy industries.â\x80\x9d Related:Â\xa0Forgotten Gas Reserves Could Be A Gamechanger For European Energy\n\n\n â\x80\x9cOur technology means that, for the first time, nuclear reactors will provide decentralised, baseload, low-carbon energy to customers with enhanced safety and security of supply. Viaroâ\x80\x99s pragmatic and forward-looking approach will help them to blaze a trail towards lower-carbon operations in the oil and gas sector and we are delighted to be partnering with them and to provide energy solutions to make their aims a reality,â\x80\x9d he added.Â\xa0 The use of the technology is expected to help decarbonise Viaroâ\x80\x99s North Sea operations, where the company produces aroundÂ\xa030,000 barrels of oilÂ\xa0a year. The firm holds non-operated stakes at around 30 offshore assets in the U.K. and the Netherlands. Viajo also announced that it had invested in newcleo, although no more information was given. This year, London-based newcleo is aiming to become one of Europeâ\x80\x99s highest-funded start-ups,Â\xa0seeking to raise $1.09 billion.Â\xa0 As the oil and gas industry looks to decarbonise operations in line with rising government pressure and higher consumer expectations, nuclear power could provide the answer. While most fossil fuel production takes place in remote locations, making it difficult to power using clean electricity from the grid, there is significant potential for the rollout of MRs and SMRs to power operations. Although the technology is in its infancy, greater investment in the technology by oil and gas firms could ensure they are some of the first companies to get access to innovative nuclear reactors as they are rolled out.Â\xa0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT']
